BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022i Foreword

    The purpose of the Ontario Traffic Manual (OTM) is to provide information and guidance for
    

transportation practitioners and to promote uniformity of treatment in the design, application and operation of traffic control devices and systems across Ontario. The objective is safe road user behaviour, achieved by a predictable roadway environment through the consistent, appropriate application of traffic control devices. Further purposes of the OTM are to provide a set of guidelines consistent with the intent of the Highway Traffic Act and to provide a basis for road authorities to generate or update their own guidelines and standards. The OTM is made up of a number of Books, which are continuously updated. The OTM is directed to its primary users, traffic practitioners. The OTM incorporates current best practices in the province of Ontario. The interpretations, recommendations and guidelines in the OTM are intended to provide an understanding of traffic operations and they cover a broad range of traffic situations encountered in practice. They are based on many factors which may determine the specific design and operational effectiveness of traffic control systems. However, no manual can cover all contingencies or all cases encountered in the field. Therefore, field experience and knowledge of application are essential in deciding what to do in the absence of specific direction from the Manual itself and in overriding any recommendations in this Manual. The traffic practitioner’s fundamental responsibility is to exercise engineering judgement and experience on technical matters in the best interests of the public and workers. Guidelines are provided in the OTM to assist in making those judgements, but they should not be used as a substitute for judgement. Design, application and operational guidelines and procedures should be used with judicious care and proper consideration of the prevailing circumstances. In some designs, applications, or operational features, the traffic practitioner’s judgement is to meet or exceed a guideline while in others a guideline might not be met for sound reasons, such as space availability, yet still produce a design or operation which may be judged to be safe. Every effort should be made to stay as close to the guidelines as possible in situations like these, and to document reasons for departures from them.

    Book 7 - Temporary Conditions (Office and Field Edition) is one of a series of volumes that makes up
    

    the Ministry of Transportation Ontario (MTO) Ontario Traffic Manual (OTM). The 2022 edition of OTM
    

Book 7 is an update to the January 2014 edition. OTM Book 7 addresses the application of traffic control devices in temporary work zones that result from highway activities such as: • Planning. • Construction. • Surveying. • Maintenance. • Work by utility companies. • Unplanned event responses. • Other work within a public highway allowance. OTM Book 7 should be read in conjunction with the following OTM series:

    • OTM Book 1 (Introduction to the OTM) and its three appendices, which provide guidelines
    

on the design and application of traffic control signs, signals, markings, and delineation devices.

    • OTM Book 2 (Sign Design, Fabrication, and Patterns) for detailed information on the
    

design and fabrication of individual signs including French language and bilingual versions of signs.

    • OTM Book 4 (Ground-Mounted Sign and Support Inspection and Maintenance).
    

    • OTM Book 5 (Regulatory Signs).
    

    • OTM Book 6 (Warning Signs).
    

    • OTM Book 8 (Guide and Information Signs).
    

    • OTM Book 10 (Dynamic Message Signs).
    

    • OTM Book 11 (Pavement, Hazard, and Delineation Markings).
    

    • OTM Book 12 (Traffic Signals).
    

    • OTM Book 15 (Pedestrian Crossing Treatments).
    

    • OTM Book 18 (Cycling Facilities).
    

Other books in the OTM series provide practical guidance on a full range of traffic control devices and their applications. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 12 SECTION 1 A complete listing of the planned and current volumes is available to download for free at the Ministry

    of Transportation Ontario (MTO) website at www.library.mto.gov.on.ca.
    

Other documents, not in the OTM series, that should be referenced during the design of temporary conditions include:

    • Transportation Association of Canada (TAC) Geometric Design Guide for Canadian Roads
    

and its MTO Design Supplement.

    • MTO Bikeways Design Manual (for Provincial highways).
    

• The MTO Roadside Design Manual.

    • Ontario Provincial Standards for Roads and Public Works (OPS).
    

    • Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA), R.S.O. 1990.
    

• Ontario Regulations for Construction Projects, O.Reg. 213/91. The most up-to-date version of these documents should be referenced. 1.1 Purpose of the Manual OTM Book 7 provides fundamental principles, guidelines, and current best practices for traffic control in temporary work zones with the goal of ensuring the protection of workers and the safe and efficient movement of highway users through work zones. Temporary works are not exclusive only to construction works, but they also include events such as road closures for parades and filming. Book 7 is intended for use by the following stakeholders:

    • Road authorities (provincial, municipal, and private road owners) in
    

Ontario and their contractors. • Utilities, designers, enforcement officers, and others who may have approval to work on public highways. Work zone safety depends on the application of several key elements which must work together as a system or a “safety chain”. These elements include:

1.  Design of the highway, construction, and maintenance plan.
2.  Traffic control plan that identifies all necessary elements.
3.  Traffic Protection Plan for the protection of workers.
4.  Training of all personnel involved in traffic control, and/or working on a highway.
5.  Contractor compliance with traffic control and Traffic Protection Plans, including safe installation, application, and removal of all necessary traffic control elements. Book 7 provides uniform guidelines for traffic control in temporary work zones. NOTE Safety in highway work zones depends on the application of a number of key elements which must work together as a system or a “safety chain”. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 1 3 SECTION 1
6.  Quality assurance checks of contractor compliance with traffic control.
7.  Safe work habits on the part of workers.
8.  Appropriate police enforcement. Safety for highway users and workers is paramount, especially workers who set-up, operate, and remove traffic control measures. If a key element is weak or absent, safety may be compromised. 1.2 Legal Authority

    Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development (MLTSD) – The MLTSD, through the Occupational
    

    Health and Safety Act (OHSA) and Regulations for Construction Projects, R.S.O. 1990 and O.Reg.
    

213/91 as amended, has the legal authority to regulate the safety of provincially regulated workers. This includes measures to protect workers from health and safety hazards on the job, including

    requirements related to traffic control persons (TCP) who direct traffic through or around a highway
    

construction site. While OTM Book 7 can be used as a tool to provide reasonable precautions that should be taken on construction projects, the OHSA and its regulations take precedence over OTM Book 7 in matters of worker safety and only the OHSA and its regulations are enforced by the MLTSD.

    The Ministry of Transportation Ontario (MTO) – The MTO, through the Highway
    

    Traffic Act (HTA), Public Transportation and Highway Improvement Act, and
    

various related statutes, has the legal authority and responsibility to regulate and control traffic on a highway and regulate and control motor vehicles that operate in the province. Municipalities – Individual municipalities have the legal authority and responsibility, through the Municipal Act and various regional municipality acts, to regulate and control traffic on their highways. The authority and responsibility also apply to construction and maintenance activities on highways.

    Road Authority – Defined as the body (municipal or provincial) that has legal jurisdiction over a
    

highway. Traffic signs, pavement markings, traffic control signals, and other devices to regulate, warn, or guide traffic are to be installed only under the approval of the road authority. When authorized, contractors, utility companies, or others may install temporary condition signs and devices to protect highway users, workers, and equipment, subject to the guidelines of Book 7, the OHSA and its regulations, and the requirements of the road authority. The OHSA and Regulations take precedence over OTM Book 7 in matters of worker safety. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 14 SECTION 1

    Contractors may be authorized by the road authority to slow upstream traffic (e.g. rolling closures).
    

The contractor may also implement short-term highway closures, as authorized by the road authority. It is the road authority’s decision whether to use contractor staff or police for these operations. Regulatory devices may need to be supported by applicable legislation, regulations, or by-laws. Effective traffic control requires both the appropriate application of traffic control devices and reasonable, effective enforcement. 1.3 Training All users must be trained on how to use OTM Book 7 as well as develop an understanding of the general principles and theories shown throughout the manual. There are three types of users of the OTM Book 7:

1.  Traffic Control Persons (TCP);
2.  Workers who design traffic control plans; and
3.  Workers who set-up, operate, and remove traffic control measures. To achieve safe and effective traffic control appropriate training of involved in the planning and installation of traffic control systems is essential. Training outcomes are: • Experience in the implementation of traffic control in the field, relevant to the work being done. • A good working knowledge of all potential hazards. • The ability to consider factors that impact communication to the driver. • The ability to install effective traffic control setups that are safe for all road users. Job specific training must be included for all users in accordance with the OHSA and the applicable regulations. Users should be trained using the Office Edition to fully understand how and when modifications to the layouts may be required. • For more information on TCP, refer to Section 4.4.2. • Workers who design traffic control plans to protect both workers and road users:

    a) Shall be a competent worker;
    

    b) Shall be knowledgeable in standards and guidelines of OTM Book 7 and the
    

    Regulations for Construction Projects;
    

    c) Shall be able to recognize the design elements of work zone traffic control;
    

and BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 1 5 SECTION 1

    d) Shall be given adequate training with respect to techniques and procedures
    

for designing effective, efficient and safe traffic control plans.

    Section 67 (6) of the O.Reg. 213/91 for Construction Projects requires that the worker who set up,
    

operate, or remove measures on a roadway or a shoulder of a roadway:

    a) Shall be a competent worker;
    

    b) Shall not perform any other work while setting up or removing the measures;
    

and

    c) Shall be given adequate written and oral instructions, in a language that they
    

understand, with respect to setting up or removing the measures. Section 23 of the O.Reg. 145/00 requires that the worker who directs vehicular traffic that may be a hazard to workers on a public way:

    a) Shall not direct vehicular traffic for more than one lane in the same direction;
    

    b) Shall not direct vehicular traffic if the normal posted speed limit of the public
    

    way is more than 90 kilometres per hour;
    

    c) Shall be a competent worker;
    

    d) Shall not perform any other work while setting up or removing the measures;
    

and

    e) Shall be given adequate written and oral instructions, in a language that they
    

understand, with respect to directing vehicular traffic, and those instructions shall include a description of the signals that are to be used. A Competent worker means a worker who:

    • Is qualified because of knowledge, training and experience to perform the work;
    

• Is familiar with the Occupational Health and Safety Act and with the provisions of the

    regulations that apply to the work; and
    

• Has knowledge of all potential or actual danger to health or safety in the work. Public way means a highway or other street, avenue, parkway, driveway, square, place, bridge, viaduct, or other open space to which the public has access, as of right or by expressed or implied invitation. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 26 SECTION 2 2 Temporary Work Zone Planning and Monitoring Section 2 describes the process of transportation management planning and monitoring in temporary work zones. Addressing worker safety, highway user safety, mobility, and accessibility requires careful consideration that starts early in project development and continues through to project completion. Early identification of project site-specific issues and potential traffic impacts can mitigate safety risk before construction commences.

    A Transportation Management Plan (TMP) consists of a coordinated set of strategies and work zone
    

safety guiding principles designed to mitigate the impacts of work zone activities during the work period. Inclusion of these strategies can help achieve the fundamental principles for work zone planning, design, and operation. The TMP includes up to five sub-plans:

1.  Traffic Protection Plan (mandatory).
2.  Traffic Control Plan (requirement of road authority).
3.  Traffic Operations Plan (optional).
4.  Public Information Plan (optional).
5.  Incident Management Plan (optional). TMP is used to define and communicate, through a clear, consistent, and structured process, a comprehensive project-specific plan for use by project stakeholders such as local road authorities, contractors, ministry staff, and the general public. Since work zone impacts and issues vary, TMP must be developed and implemented to best serve the unique needs of each work zone. The scope, content, and level of detail of a TMP may vary based on the local road authority’s work zone policies and the anticipated work zone impacts of the project. The TMP is a living document and will evolve throughout the life cycle of the project. 2.1 Fundamental Principles for Work Zone Planning, Design, and Operation The following fundamental principles, in Table 2.1, provide the basis upon which work zones should be planned, designed, and operated. Ideally, each principle below will be fully incorporated into work zone design, however, since these principles are not always mutually exclusive, fully incorporating one BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 2 7 SECTION 2 principle may comprise another. Practitioners who plan, design, or operate work zones must therefore strike the appropriate balance. Table 2.1 Fundamental Principles PRINCIPLE DESCRIPTION Worker safety The safety of construction workers within the construction zone. Road user safety The safety of motorists, cyclists, pedestrians, transit users and enforcement/emergency personnel travelling through the construction zone. Mobility and accessibility Highway user movement should be inhibited as little as practicable. When this principle is followed, speed changes, and differentials are minimal and traffic progression is maintained, thereby increasing safety. Accessibility and mobility for pedestrians and cyclists is an important consideration. Communication and positive guidance Highway users should receive pertinent information at the times

    and locations needed to make appropriate decisions (e.g. speed
    

    or lane changes). Equipping highway users with clear, consistent,
    

timely, and relevant information can help them prepare for unusual circumstances when approaching and navigating the work zone. Consistency and uniformity All messages should be consistent, unambiguous, easily, and quickly understood, and should provide only necessary information. Work zone design across the province should be kept consistent as practicable by following the guidelines in this manual. Constructability Projects should be planned, designed, and built as effectively and efficiently as possible to shorten the work duration and reduce cumulative risk exposure. 2.2 Transportation Management Planning Process

    Figure 2.1 presents the process (steps) for developing and implementing a TMP. Practitioners should
    

begin developing the TMP early in the project planning process and should update the Plan frequently throughout project design and construction. Detailed guidelines for each step in the process are included in the following sections. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 28 SECTION 2

    2.2.1 Collect Project Information (Step 1)
    

Table 2.2 presents examples of project information to be collected for the TMP, including references to Sections in the Manual where further information can be found. The level of detail required for the TMP will vary based on the scope of the project and requirements of the local road authority.

    2.2.2 Identify, Assess, and Manage Risks (Step 2)
    

The level of planning and effort required in preparing a TMP for a work zone is dependent on the expected worksite hazards and risks. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 210 SECTION 2 Assessing project hazards and risks is the process of:

    • Reviewing site-specific characteristics;
    

    • Identifying the hazards and risks; and
    

• Consideration of the likelihood and consequences of each. A risk assessment process should be undertaken during initial preparation of the TMP, and the outcome should be used to develop appropriate strategies for managing and mitigating risks. Early identification and documentation of risks that may arise during a project acts as a preliminary filter to separate work zones that require in-depth planning and preparation from those that do not. Examples of factors which may result in greater risk may include, but are not limited to, the following presented in Table 2.3: Table 2.3 Potential Risk Factors RISK FACTOR DESCRIPTION Speed Higher speeds reduce the time a driver can recognize, inter- pret, and react to work zone conditions. Lateral space Workers are at greater risk of being injured by vehicles intrud- ing into the work space when they are closer to a live lane of traffic, especially at higher speeds. Location of work Workers are at greater risk in areas with limited escape routes such as on bridge structures or other confined areas. Pedestrian and cyclist traffic Pedestrians and cyclists are vulnerable highway users and are at risk if not accommodated adequately. Project scope and duration Longer duration work zones increase the amount of cumulative time workers and highway users are exposed to safety risks. Anticipated traffic volumes High traffic volumes increase highway user and worker expo- sure to safety risks due to the number of potential conflicts. Time of day Night time work presents challenges such as visibility and conspicuity. Space restrictions

    (longitudinal)
    

Work zones are considered higher risk if standard lengths

    for component areas (Section 3.4) cannot be achieved due to
    

    space restrictions (e.g. driveways, side streets).
    

Sight line restrictions Workers are at higher risk if adequate sight lines are not provided for drivers to recognize, interpret, and react to work zone condi- tions. Sight line obstructions may include horizontal and vertical

    curves (e.g. hills) or roadside obstructions.
    

BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 2 11 SECTION 2 RISK FACTOR DESCRIPTION Observed safety issues Determine if the project location has a high collision history under typical conditions, if stakeholders are aware of any exist- ing safety issues, or if any obvious safety issues were identi- fied during a site visit. Locations with existing safety issues are considered higher risk. Inclement weather Conditions such as fog, snow, rain, and heavy winds can affect sight distance and stopping distance for vehicles. Intersections and driveways Intersections and driveways may cause longitudinal space re-

    strictions (see above). In addition, intersections and driveways
    

increase the number of movements and potential conflicts near the work zone. Condition of highway surface Highway surfaces in poor condition may affect driver maneu- vering ability and stopping distance. Bus stops and bus lanes Buses make frequent stops and may increase potential for con- flicts. Areas with bus service are more likely to have a higher pedestrian presence.

    Vehicle types (e.g. trucks) Large trucks have longer stopping distances and different sight
    

lines than passenger vehicles. Overall work zone risk should be assessed considering: • Level of risk for individual factors. • The number of contributing factors. • Potential interaction between various risk factors. For example, a narrow lateral buffer space presents a greater risk when operating speeds are higher.

    2.2.2.1 Consider Hierarchy of Risk Controls (Step 2a)
    

A hierarchical approach should be used when considering and evaluating the control of risk in work zones, starting with the most effective approach and justifying decisions for implementing less- effective measures.

    The fundamental principles of work zone planning, design, and operation (Section 2.1) and Steps 1,
    

2, and 2b of the TMP process should also be considered in the evaluation, and trade-offs between principles should be documented. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 212 SECTION 2 Table 2.4 provides a hierarchy of risk control measures and examples of strategies for each. Noting that certain strategies many not be available, practical, or feasible, many work zones will require a combination of these strategies to best mitigate risk. Table 2.4 Hierarchy of Risk Control Measures PRINCIPLE DESCRIPTION EXAMPLE STRATEGIES

1.  Risk elimination

    (most effective)
    

• Remove risk from work zone. • Eliminate highway user and worker interaction. • Full highway or ramp closure. 2. Exposure control • Reduce exposure to potential conflicts between highway users and workers. • Reduce number or proximity of vehicles travelling adjacent to workers. • Crossover. • Diversion. • Additional lane closure. • Rolling closure. 3. Positive protection • Use positive protection devices to physically prevent highway users from leaving travelled path. • Effective at protecting workers but may increase hazard to highway users.

    • Buffer Vehicles (4.5.1).
    

    • Barriers (4.5.3-4.5.4).
    

• Vehicle arresting systems

    (4.5.5-4.5.6).
    

4.  Behavioural and administrative controls

    (least effective)
    

• Controls to manage highway user and worker behaviour. • Should be considered for all work zones even when higher-order controls are used. • Speed management

    techniques (3.6).
    

• Traffic control devices

    (4.4-4.5).
    

• Temporal work strategies

    (e.g., off-peak).
    

    2.2.2.2 Assess Work Zone Impacts (Step 2b)
    

Impacts of work zone design and operations strategies developed in the TMP should be understood by both the practitioner and the road authority. These impacts will affect decisions regarding the proposed design and operations strategies. During project life cycles, the TMP must be revised according to

    these impacts and the hierarchy of risk control treatments (Step 2a).
    

BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 2 13 SECTION 2

    Highway type and cross-section (e.g., multi-lane undivided)
    

    Location type (general, segment, intersection or roundabout)
    

    Closure type (shoulder, lane encroachment, lane closure, etc.)
    

Work duration or other characteristics Examples of work zone impacts include: • Traffic impacts such as delays to motorists, queues, and congestion. • Impacts to other highway users such as pedestrians, cyclists, and transit. In general, projects with higher risk, longer duration, and more disruptive configurations will require a detailed impact assessment, while others will require only a high-level impact assessment.

    2.2.3 Develop Traffic Control Plan(s) (Steps 3, 4, and 5)
    

    2.2.3.1 Select Relevant Layout (Step 3)
    

Section 6 of this manual contains layouts for work zone design, including decision matrices to assist with selecting the most applicable layout, given work zone requirements and characteristics outlined in Step 1. The layouts are organized by the following hierarchical structure:

    2.2.3.2 Develop Traffic Control Plan by Applying or Modifying Layout(s) to
    

    Address Site Specifics (Step 4)
    

Depending on the characteristics of the project work zone, a layout may be implemented without

    any modifications. However, work zones with greater risk (as determined in Step 2) may require
    

modifications to the layout. Additionally, multiple layouts may be involved in developing the TMP due to different stages of work. For high-risk complex projects, qualified and experienced practitioners should develop customized Traffic Control Plans based on layouts but designed specifically for the site.

    2.2.3.3 Develop Traffic Protection Plan (Step 5)
    

    A Traffic Protection Plan (TPP) is required under Ontario Regulation 213/91, Section 4-5 for all projects:
    

TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 214 SECTION 2 “Every employer shall develop in writing and implement a traffic protection plan for the employers’ workers at a project if any of them may be exposed to a hazard from vehicular traffic. The traffic protection plan shall specify the vehicular traffic

    hazards and the measures … to be used to protect workers; and shall be kept at the
    

project and made available to an inspector or a worker on request.” If the core TMP has been developed as outlined, practitioners should be able to transcribe much of the content for the TPP from the TMP, including the Traffic Control Plans and other information related directly to the vehicular traffic hazards and associated protection measures for their workers. According to the Ministry of Labour, an effective TPP may include: • Assignment of roles and responsibilities for parties who may be exposed to traffic hazards. • Training standards. • Protective equipment requirements. • Inspection procedures. • Safe work procedures and practices.

    2.2.4 Develop Additional Plan(s) (as required) (Step 6)
    

A TPP is required as part of the TMP for every project. Depending on the type, complexity, and level of risk of the project, the following plans may also be used in developing the TMP: • Transportation Operations Plan • Public Information Plan • Internal Traffic Control Plan • Incident Management Plan These Plans are described in the following Section.

    2.2.4.1 Other Plans (If Required)
    

    Transportation Operations Plan (TOP)
    

    A Transportation Operations Plan (TOP) includes strategies used to mitigate work zone impacts using
    

improved traffic operations and management techniques. Strategies include: • Vehicle restriction strategies. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 2 15 SECTION 2 • Alternative traffic flow strategies.

    • Improvements to the transportation network because of restrictions (signal timing
    

    modifications or detour routes).
    

Lessons learned from the past and/or recommendations previously made should be considered when developing a TOP.

    Public Information Plan (PIP)
    

    A Public Information Plan (PIP) includes actions and procedures for informing:
    

    • The travelling public;
    

    • The general public;
    

    • Area residences and businesses; and,
    

• The local road authority about expected work zone impacts.

    Communication method(s) best suited for the project should be considered. These methods include:
    

    • Public information centres;
    

    • Broadcast on radio and television;
    

    • Highway signs; and,
    

• Social media. The Plan can help warn drivers of upcoming work zones and provide information to drivers both pre- trip and enroute, allowing drivers to make informed decisions about the route to take and when to travel.

    Internal Traffic Control Plan (ITCP)
    

    An Internal Traffic Control Plan (ITCP) coordinates and assigns the flow of work vehicles, work
    

equipment, and workers within the work zone to ensure worker safety and should include elements such as: • Highway user paths. • Work vehicle and equipment paths. • Ingress and egress points. • Storage and staging areas.

    Incident Management Plan (IMP)
    

    An Incident Management Plan (IMP) outlines priorities and procedures for detecting and rapidly
    

responding to unplanned events to minimize impact on: TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 216 SECTION 2

1.  The safety of workers and the public.
2.  Mobility in order to restore traffic flow. Following an incident, it is critical to document the events that initiated the incident so the TMP can be re-evaluated to determine if any changes are necessary. 2.3 Implementation and Monitoring

    2.3.1 Obtain Approvals (Step 7)
    

Once the TMP and any required additional plans have been developed, approval must be obtained from all authorities having jurisdiction. The following steps should be taken to ensure the proper approvals have been received and notifications have been provided:

1.  Ensure knowledge of all applicable regulations, permit requirements, and work restrictions.
2.  Obtain the necessary approvals from the local road authority when:

    a) Establishing a designated construction zone.
    

    b) Posting reduced regulatory speed limits.
    

    c) Using partial lane shifts.
    

    d) Using portable or non-portable temporary traffic signals.
    

    e) Conducting traffic control with moving vehicles other than for setup or
    

removal.

    f) Applying orange pavement markings.
    

    g) Deploying Portable Variable Message Signs (PVMS).
    

    h) Installing speed display signs.
    

    i) Using a mobile barrier vehicle.
    

    j) Applying a new technology.
    

3.  Notify police, fire department, emergency medical services (EMS), transit authorities, road authority, and any other agencies which may be affected by the maintenance, construction, or other work activities.
4.  Provide notice to the public of the works planned or in progress (as outlined in the Public

    Information Plan) through local media and signage.
    

5.  Inform occupants of abutting properties, either orally or by written notice, of parking

    prohibitions or access limitations (as outlined in the Public Information Plan).
    

BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 2 17 SECTION 2 6. Discuss speed control and enforcement with the police and road authorities.

    2.3.2 Implementation (Step 8)
    

Implementation of plans associated with the TMP should be completed as outlined in the TMP and additional plans, and according to all approval conditions from authorities having jurisdiction. Methodology for the setup and removal of traffic control devices, utilized in the Traffic Control Plan, can be found in Section 4.

    2.3.3 Monitoring (Step 9)
    

The ongoing inspection and monitoring of work zones are important to ensure that the appropriate

    traffic control devices are in the appropriate place at all times (as outlined in the TMP and Traffic
    

    Control Plan) and that the TMP strategies are effective in serving their purpose. TMP should be updated
    

as adjustments are required, based on observations during monitoring. Guidelines for inspection and monitoring can be found in Section 4. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 318 SECTION 3 3 Temporary Work Zone Design Section 3 outlines the fundamental principles of work zone design, explains terminology for defining the section of highway and temporary configuration, and outlines work zone design considerations for highway users. Information contained in this section is intended to assist the reader in understanding the guidelines presented in OTM Book 7 and evaluating situations that are either not explicitly demonstrated in the layouts or require sound engineering judgement. Definitions provided will be of interest to users who are required to either modify a layout or develop a new layout for a unique situation. The following components of temporary work zone design are discussed in Section 3:

1.  Fundamental principles.
2.  Defining the highway environment.
3.  Configurations for temporary conditions.
4.  Component areas for temporary conditions.
5.  Duration of work.
6.  Speed management in temporary work zones.
7.  Active road user considerations.
8.  Visibility considerations. 3.1 Fundamental Principles of Work Zone Design

    Risk to highway users, (motorists, pedestrians, cyclists, and others) and workers
    

can be reduced by providing a predictable and intuitive highway environment. Consistent and appropriate application of traffic control devices throughout work zones increases the probability of users exhibiting desired behaviours. +NOTE As discussed in Section 2.1, highway work zones should be designed around the following basic principles:

1.  Worker safety.
2.  Highway user safety.
3.  Mobility and accessibility.
4.  Communication and positive guidance.
5.  Consistency and uniformity.
6.  Constructability. Risk to highway users and workers can be reduced by providing a predictable and intuitive roadway environment. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 3 19 SECTION 3 These basic principles must be explicitly designed into construction, maintenance, or other projects on a public highway, rather than applied on a makeshift basis. Workers in the work area are exposed to different hazards than workers installing and removing traffic control measures. Therefore, it is important that training be appropriate for the: • Type of work being done. • Level of exposure to traffic. • Level of hazard the worker is exposed to. For example, traffic control installers face different hazard levels on a 60 km/h highway than on a complex freeway and training should be completed in accordance with the maximum level of hazard. Traffic control installers do not have the ability to remove the hazard of the traffic they are exposed to and must be extremely aware of this issue. Users of OTM Book 7 should ensure that:
7.  Traffic movement is interfered with or inhibited as little as possible. • Frequent or unnecessary changes in highway configuration, such as sudden lane narrowing, lane closures, or reductions in speeds should be avoided. • Precautions are taken to ensure that construction equipment can be safely operated without being hazardous to passing traffic. • Highway occupancy and work completion time is minimized to reduce exposure to potential hazards.
8.  The public is informed of long duration operations. • Highway users are provided with current information on the existence of a work site, the reason behind the work, and the current status of the work.
9.  Adequate and consistent use of traffic control devices are provided.+NOTE • Highway users are guided by appropriate combinations of: ⚪ Signs. ⚪ Channelizing devices. ⚪ Pavement markings. ⚪ Traffic signals.

    ⚪ Traffic Control Persons (TCP).
    

Traffic control installers do not have the ability to remove the hazard of the traffic they are exposed to and must be extremely aware of this issue. NOTE On provincial highways, approval is required for the use of any traffic

    control device(s)
    

not shown in OTM Book 7, including the use of non-standard combinations or configurations of otherwise standard devices. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 320 SECTION 3 4. The plan for worker safety is communicated. • Workers must understand the general principles of work zone safety.

    • A Traffic Protection Plan (TPP) must be prepared in advance for any
    

construction project, conforming with the policies and guidelines of the highway authority and Ministry of Labour, Trades and Skill Development

    (MLTSD) requirements. +NOTE
    

• The TPP must be communicated to workers in a language they can understand. • Workers must also be knowledgeable of general principles of work zone safety. 5. Work Zone traffic controls are continually monitored and updated. These practices help to ensure the credibility and reliability of the traffic control system, thus increasing the probability of driver compliance. • Elements and devices that make up the traffic control system must be regularly monitored to ensure they remain in place, are undamaged and are visible as intended, and there are no obvious signs that motorists are having difficulty navigating the work zone. +NOTE • Traffic controls reflect actual conditions and are continually updated to suit changing conditions due to work staging and progress. • All traffic control devices for temporary conditions are removed when no longer needed. • When work is suspended for short periods of time, advance warning signs, and other inappropriate devices are removed, covered, or turned so they are not visible to highway users. • Traffic control is monitored to ensure that there are no obvious signs that motorists are having difficulty navigating the work zone. 3.2 Defining the Highway Environment Application of the guidelines provided in Book 7 requires defining the highway environment affected by the temporary condition based on:

1.  Area type.
2.  Highway type.
3.  Cross-Section.
4.  Traffic Volume. All traffic control devices for temporary conditions must be removed when no longer needed. NOTE A Traffic Protection

    Plan (TPP) must
    

be prepared in advance for any construction project. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 3 21 SECTION 3 These elements are further described below.

    3.2.1 Area Type (Urban or Rural)
    

The following table contains typical characteristics of urban and rural area types, challenges that may be encountered in these environments, and alternatives to consider in rectifying these challenges: Table 3.1 Urban and Rural Area Types Area Type Urban Rural Typical

    characteristics:
    

• Limited maneuvering space. • Frequent turns and cross movements. • Need for pedestrian and cyclist protection. • Prevalence of street furniture and buildings. • Presence of curb and gutter. • Transit. • Long trip distances. • Rare congestion. • Few alternate routes. • Sparsely spaced driveways and highway crossings. • Minimal development adjacent to the highway. • Primarily natural or agricultural environment. • Lacking curb and gutter. Typical issues: • Cluttering of signs. • Lack of shoulders and available space for placement of signs. • Non-compliance by highway users. • Short spacing between streets. • Addressing needs of multiple user types. • AODA requirements.

    • Multiple access (driveways,
    

    lane ways) and bus stops.
    

• Increased presence of wildlife. • Lack of illumination. • Higher vehicular speed. • Travelers may be unfamiliar with their surroundings. • Driver fatigue. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 322 SECTION 3 Area Type Urban Rural Alternatives to

    consider:
    

• On wide streets with high traffic speeds and volumes, use additional signs to attract motorist attention. • The required advance distances for the placement of warning signs, shown in OTM Book 7 layouts, must be adhered to as closely as practicable, but may have to be reduced where there are frequent driveways and short block lengths. • Consider using active control devices such as flashing arrow boards and variable message signs if the required advanced distances for warning sign placement cannot be satisfied. • If recommended taper length cannot be satisfied due to multiple entrance driveways, use additional traffic control devices, such as TC-12 flashing arrow board or reduced barrel spacing. • Where there are high volumes and expected long delays, install additional notification signs prior to work commencement. • If visibility is limited by the highway geometry or other obstacles, provide additional signs and extend the taper lengths shown in Book 7 layouts. • If the temporary condition causes a queue, use additional signs in advance of queue to warn motorists and consider any limited visibility due to the highway geometry. • Wear highly reflective apparel such as fluorescent vests or overalls. • Use enhanced lighting on TC-22 to increase visibility. • Use of more active traffic control devices. • Use operating speed instead of normal posted regulatory

    speed (NPRS) as the criteria
    

for traffic control layout. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 3 23 SECTION 3

    3.2.2 Highway Type (Freeway or Non-Freeway)
    

The following table contains criteria that define freeway and non-freeway highway types. Table 3.2 Freeway and Non-Freeway Highway Types Highway Type Freeway Non-Freeway • A highway having all of the following

    criteria:
    

⚪ A multi-lane, divided highway with

    more than four (4) through lanes
    

    total [two (2) through lanes in each
    

direction\] with a continuous dividing median. ⚪ Full controlled access road limited to through traffic, with access through interchanges. ⚪ A normal posted regulatory speed

    (NPRS) of 90 km/h or greater.
    

• All 400-series divided highways and toll highways built to freeway configuration. • All freeway speed transition zones where the speed limit has been reduced approaching the end of the freeway, and other areas where speed reductions are in place due to geometrics such as curves or freeway to freeway ramps. • Any section of highway not matching the criteria of freeway.

    3.2.3 Cross-Section (Two-Lane, Multi-Lane Divided or Undivided)
    

    The following table contains criteria that define two-lane and multi-lane (divided and undivided) cross-
    

sections. For the purposes of traffic control, road authorities may designate some high volume and/or high-speed non-freeways as freeways. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 324 SECTION 3 Table 3.3 Cross-Section Types Cross-Section Type Two-Lane Multi-Lane Highways with a single lane dedicated to each direction in two-way traffic. Highways with more than one lane dedicated to each direction in two-way traffic. Divided Undivided Physically divide the two-way traffic with dirt, grass, or raised medians. Does not physically divide the two-way traffic. The two opposing directions are delineated with yellow pavement markings.

    3.2.4 Traffic Volume (Low Volume or High Volume)
    

Traffic volume assessments should be conducted and include: • Volume variation with time of day. • Consideration to the impact to traffic control requirements. Criteria that define low volume vs. high volume traffic are included in the following table: Table 3.4 Traffic Volume Traffic Volume Low Volume High Volume • For temporary conditions, low volume highways are defined as those with a combined traffic volume in both directions of less than 3,000 vehicles per day. • Low volume highways often experience higher observed speeds. • High volume highways are those with a combined traffic volume of 3,000 vehicles per day or more. • High volume highways require greater traffic flow control. 3.3 Configurations for Temporary Conditions Configurations for temporary conditions include varying degrees of complexity and levels of intrusion, and can be categorized as:

1.  Off-shoulder.
2.  Shoulder.
3.  Lane encroachment.
4.  Partial lane shift(s). BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 3 25 SECTION 3
5.  Lane closure(s) or lane occupied.
6.  Detour.
7.  Rolling closure. These configurations are further defined below. 3.3.1 Off-Shoulder Off-Shoulder work is defined as: • Work within the right-of-way, but completely beyond the shoulder of the highway, such

    that workers, equipment, or vehicles (including parked vehicles) do not encroach onto the
    

shoulder. • Where a shoulder is not clearly defined, the work can be considered off-shoulder if the work area, including all work vehicles and equipment, is beyond 3.0 metres from the edge of the travelled portion of the highway. • Work that requires no traffic control devices, but TC-2A or TC-2B should be used to notify drivers that there is work. On provincial highways, off-shoulder work should comply with the Roadside Design Manual. 3.3.2 Shoulder Shoulder is defined as: • That portion of the highway between the edge of the travelled portion of the highway and the curb or point of intersection of the slope lines at the outer edge of a highway and the fill, ditch, or median slope, for the accommodation of: ⚪ Stopped vehicles, emergency vehicles, and for lateral support. ⚪ Workers, vehicles, equipment, and traffic control devices which remain on the shoulder and do not encroach into the travelled lanes. Examples of layouts for reference purposes: TS-5, US-5, DS-5, FS-1, FS-2. 3.3.3 Lane Encroachment Lane encroachment refers to a configuration where: • Workers, vehicles, or equipment are partially within the travelled lane,

    but there is at least 3.0 metres (3.5 metres for freeways) in width of
    

useable lane for traffic.+NOTE Lane encroachment is not recommended on freeways. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 326 SECTION 3 • Except where required for some maintenance mobile operations, lane encroachment is not recommended on freeways. Examples of layouts for reference purposes: TS-6, TS-7, US-7, DS-7.

    3.3.4 Partial Lane Shift(s)
    

A Partial Lane Shift is a configuration where: • More than one lane is temporarily realigned and is used when: ⚪ Encroachment of highway operations will result in a traffic lane width of less than 3.0 metres. However, squeezing all lanes minimally will provide lane widths that are at least 3.0 m for each lane. Lane shifts are generally less than 1.0 metre, however:+NOTE • Lane shifts greater than 1.0 metre on a typical two-lane highway occur only rarely, as this would create lane widths of less than 3.0 metres, in which case a lane closure must be used. • Lane shifts greater than 1.0 metre can occur on two-lane highways with parking spaces on one or both sides with parking temporarily removed and parking area occupied by the shifted lane.

    Lane shifts avoid the closure of one lane and can avoid the use of a TCP(s),
    

however, additional precautions must be given to worker safety during set-up and take down of traffic control devices. The following table contains situations where partial lane shifts may be used: Table 3.5 Situations to Apply Partial Lane Shift Partial Lane Shift Situation Comments

1.  For short work areas (up to 50 metres) where visibility is good.
2.  On two-lane highways where NPRS is:

    a) 60 km/h or lower (low- and high-vol-
    

    ume highways).
    

    b) 70 km/h or higher (low-volume high-
    

    ways only).
    

• Partial lane shifts must not be used where normal posted regulatory speed is 90 km/h or higher. Partial lane shifts must not be used where NPRS is 90 km/h or higher. Narrowed lanes are used for multi-lane roads where NPRS is higher than 80 km/h. Partial lane shifts can avoid the use of

    TCP(s).
    

NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 3 27 SECTION 3 Partial Lane Shift Situation Comments 3. On multi-lane highways where NPRS is 90 km/h or higher, lane shifting is achieved using narrowed lanes. • Lane widths should be at least 3.5 m for freeways. • Lanes must not be demarcated by only cones, but achieved using one or more of the following: ⚪ Temporary Construction Barrier

    System (TCBS) to provide work area
    

    protection;
    

⚪ Construction markers or barrels for

    tapers; and/or,
    

⚪ Temporary pavement markings for lane demarcation, along with removal of existing pavement markings. • Higher speeds require more advance notice and a more gradual transition, with an appropriate taper length in advance of the lane shift. Highway Surface:

    a) Within the hard surface of a highway. • Typically, the best scenario for partial lane
    

shifting.

    b) Within the gravel shoulder of a
    

highway. • Posted speed reduction is required.

    c) Within an all-gravel highway surface. • Vehicles should not be directed off the
    

highway onto a shoulder that is soft or has a different texture. • Abilities of vulnerable highway users such as motorcycles, cyclists, and pedestrians should be considered when a lane is shifted onto an unpaved surface. Examples of layouts for reference purposes: TS-8, TS-9, US-10, DS-10.

    3.3.5 Lane Closure(s) or Lane Occupied
    

    Lane Closure(s) or Lane Occupied are configurations where travelled lane(s) are closed off and traffic is
    

redirected, and are used when:

    • Highway operations result in lane widths of less than 3.0 metres (3.5 metres for freeways).
    

• Operations occupy a travelled lane. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 328 SECTION 3 Examples of layouts for reference purposes: TS-12, US-13, DS-13, FS-6. 3.3.6 Detours A detour configuration occurs when traffic cannot be adequately accommodated within an existing highway and must be diverted from its normal path. Guidance of traffic through detours requires signage that is continuous and complete to guide drivers back to the normal route. Types of detours include:

1.  Highway Diversion – traffic in both directions is required to make a short diversion, within the highway right-of-way, to bypass the work area.
2.  Lane Realignment – traffic in one direction is diverted from its normal path onto an alternate alignment around a temporary work area.+NOTE
3.  Route Detour – Traffic is required to completely depart from the normal route and directed to use alternate roads. A route detour typically occurs when:

    a) The road capacity is reduced to the point where some of the traffic
    

must be redirected due to excessive delays.

    b) The highway is entirely closed requiring an alternate route. The alternate route
    

will be signed using a combination of appropriate TC-10 directional signs. Except in an emergency, prior to the closing of a provincial highway and the opening of a route detour, the following steps should be taken:

1.  Assess detour to ensure trucks can navigate through the route.
2.  Check with municipal by-laws to ensure trucks can be accommodated through route.
3.  A pre-construction planning meeting should be held with the representatives of the road authority, police, EMS, and fire departments as well as any affected transit authority to advise them of the situation and allow them to assess how this will affect their functions and responsibilities.+NOTE
4.  Involving a neighbouring municipality or different level of government

    may be necessary when their highway(s) intersect or are significantly
    

affected by the route detour. 5. Information regarding the closing may be posted on the road authority’s website and/or given to media outlets and local newspapers, in accordance with road authority policy. Guidance of traffic through detours requires signage that is continuous and complete. NOTE Where detours are to be used, a pre-construction planning meeting should be held with representatives of the road authority, police, EMS, fire department, and transit authority. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 3 29 SECTION 3 6. Notices may also be distributed to affected households and businesses to advise them of the upcoming disruption in their area. 7. A highway closing information sign must be erected at strategically selected locations of the highway at least one week in advance of the actual closing. 8. Construction ahead signs must be installed when work first commences and the detour signs must not be exposed to view until the detour is required. 9. Before a route or a temporary detour is opened to the public, all signs pertinent to the condition must be installed in their proper positions.

    On some highways, particularly on freeways, it may be preferable to close specific sections (such as
    

    longitudinal sections or one of the highways in an express/collector configuration) without providing
    

specific route detours. In this case: • Drivers, usually commuters who are familiar with the highway network, can make their own decisions on alternate routes.+NOTE • Advisory signage of highway closures may be provided with either

    static signs or Portable Variable Message Signs (PVMS). Information
    

provided on the signage would include: ⚪ Highway section being closed. ⚪ Hours being closed.

    ⚪ Period of closure (start and finish dates).
    

⚪ To avoid information overload for drivers, it may be necessary to provide information

    on successive signs (or PVMS) in phases, rather than on a single sign or sign display.
    

⚪ Signage should be designed in accordance with the sign design principles provided in OTM Book 2. Examples of layouts for reference purposes: TS-21, TS-22, TI-14, TI-15, UI-25, UI-26, DI-25, DI-26. 3.3.7 Rolling Closures

    During rolling closures, lead vehicles such as police car(s), Crash Truck(s), and/or sign truck(s), are
    

used to control the speed and restrain vehicles upstream of a construction site, so as to create a time

    window (usually 5 to 15 minutes) when the highway downstream is effectively clear of vehicles.
    

This creates an unhindered opportunity for workers to do work and/or make traffic control changes at the work site while clear of live traffic.

    Situations where rolling closures may be a good method of traffic control are Intermittent Duration (ID)
    

operations where traffic can safely and efficiently be prevented temporarily from entering the work Before a route or a temporary detour is opened, all pertinent signs must be installed in their proper positions. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 330 SECTION 3 zone. Examples include: • Changing a lane closure on a freeway from a right lane closure to a left lane closure, or vice versa. • Installing or removing an overhead sign structure. It is the decision of the road authority to use rolling closures. Paid duty police officers are required for freeway rolling closures due to increased hazard levels. Refer to Section 4.4.4 for traffic control using moving vehicles. 3.4 Component Areas for Temporary Conditions A construction zone encompasses the full length of a project. Within a construction zone: • There may be one or more work zones. • The road authority may legally establish speed fines which are doubled when workers are present. A work zone is an area where traffic control devices have been set up to provide positive guidance to highway users through a temporary situation and include the entire section from the first advance warning sign through to the last traffic control device, where traffic returns to its normal path and conditions. A work zone can be in any of the configurations described in Section 3.3. They may be stationary or mobile and should use up as little street space as possible. A well-designed work zone normally contains six distinct component areas in the following sequence, and further described in the Sections below:

1.  Advance warning area.+NOTE
2.  Approach area.
3.  Transition area.
4.  Longitudinal buffer area.
5.  Work area.
6.  Termination area. Figure 3.1, below, shows Component Areas for Construction Zones and Work Zones. A well-designed work zone normally contains six distinct component areas. NOTE Use of paid duty police officers is required for rolling closures on freeways. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 3 31 SECTION 3 Figure 3.1 Component Areas Contract Limits/ Designated Construction Zone Limit of Construction/ Work Zone Speed Reduction Zone WORKZONE WORKZONE CONTRACT LIMITS/ DESIGNATED CONSTRUCTION ZONE LIMIT OF CONSTRUCTION/ WORK ZONE SPEED REDUCTION ZONE WORKAREA TerminationArea ApproachArea AdvanceWarning Area LongitudinalBuffer Area TransitionArea SPEED REDUCTION ZONE WORKAREA TerminationArea ApproachArea AdvanceWarning Area LongitudinalBuffer Area TransitionArea

    See: TG-2, UG-2, DG-2, FG-2 and Section 3.6 for designated construction zone signage.
    

3.4.1 Advance Warning Area The advance warning area alerts highway users of highway work ahead and should be actively monitored. If queues extend beyond advance warning signs, additional traffic control devices should be set up in advance of the anticipated and/or observed end of a queue. The advance warning area may need to be increased to accommodate obstacles such as: • Interchanges. • Bridges. • Sightline restrictions. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 332 SECTION 3

    Required distances for the placement of advance warning area signs, shown in Section 6 (Layouts),
    

must be adhered to as closely as practicable. 3.4.2 Approach Area The approach area is used to inform highway users of actions that are required or prohibited such as: • Lane changes. • Speed reductions. • Passing restrictions, etc. Highway users require this information at a sufficient distance in advance, to be able to adjust to the altered situation before reaching it. Approach area devices may vary from a single sign or flashing lights, to a series of signs in advance of the transition area.

    Required distances for the placement of approach area devices, shown in Section 6 (Layouts), must be
    

adhered to as closely as practicable. 3.4.3 Transition Area The transition area channels traffic from the normal path to a new path required to move traffic past the work area. Work material, vehicles, and equipment must not be stored or parked in transition areas. Transition areas must be: • Obvious to highway users, with intended travel path clearly delineated so they do not mistakenly follow the wrong path. +NOTE • Delineated by channelizing devices unless otherwise indicated in the layouts.

    • Composed of tapers and parallel sections (if more than one lane is closed) to effectively
    

close the lanes. Parallel sections, referenced above, are the lengths between successive tapers and are not the same as

    Longitudinal Buffer Areas (LBA) described in the next section.
    

Delineating the Transition Taper One of the most important elements in the layout of traffic control devices is the transition taper for full lane closure or other reductions in pavement width. Guidelines for delineating the transition taper

    follows:
    

Transition areas must be obvious to highway users NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 3 33 SECTION 3 • When used for channelizing in a transition taper, devices should provide a smooth and gradual transition that is constant and easily interpreted. • An inadequate taper is likely to produce undesirable traffic operations with resulting congestion and the possibility of collisions through the work zone or encroachment into the work area. • Vehicles and equipment must not be kept in the taper area, except for TC-12 Flashing Arrow Boards. +NOTE • The minimum desirable taper length for various approach speeds and device spacing is provided in Table A, Table B, and Table C in Section 6. These tables also provide guidance as to speed-related distances and spacing relationships for the placement of general warning signs, and other guidance and information devices.

    If visibility is limited by a horizontal or vertical curve, a taper might need to be lengthened (beyond the
    

    length shown in layouts) to give drivers adequate warning and visibility of the start of the taper.
    

For long duration operations, there may be a requirement to remove or mask existing pavement markings and enhance the transition area with temporary pavement markings to identify a clear route, where there could be confusion about the proper path.

    3.4.4 Longitudinal Buffer Areas (LBA)
    

An LBA is an empty space between the end of the transition area and the work area or Buffer Vehicle

    (BV) that out of control vehicles can use to brake to a full stop.
    

LBA provides protection for traffic and workers, by providing an opportunity for highway users to brake to a halt. Traffic control devices, work material, vehicles, and equipment must not be stored or parked in an LBA.

    When an LBA is used with a BV, the appropriate distance to use in front (downstream) of the BV is
    

    called the Lateral Intrusion Deterrence Gap (LIDG). The LIDG is used in combination with the taper,
    

    LBA, and BV (see Section 4.5).
    

An LBA is recommended in all situations where practicable and may be used in circumstances not indicated in the layouts. As a guideline, LBA is not required: • For partial lane shifts, provided lane widths of at least 3.0 metres are maintained. +NOTE • For non-freeway shoulder operations. When used for channelizing in a transition taper, devices should provide a smooth and gradual transition. NOTE Traffic control devices, work material, vehicles, and equipment must not be stored or parked in an LBA. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 334 SECTION 3

    • Where traffic is controlled using TCP, Automated Flagger Assistance Devices (AFAD),
    

    Portable Lane Control Signals (PLCS), or Portable Temporary Traffic Signals (PTTS).
    

• In urban areas where normal posted speeds are 60 km/h or lower. • Drivers face more stimuli, including traffic signals, and are less likely to be drowsy or inattentive. Other traffic control devices in the work zone should be sufficient to alert drivers of the work area ahead, without requiring an LBA. LBA lengths are included in Table A, Table B, Table C, and Table D and illustrated on the layouts, where applicable. For more information on LBA, refer to O. Reg. 213/91, s. 67. 3.4.5 Work Area The work area is an area where the work takes place and/or equipment and material are stored. The work area: • May or may not contain a work vehicle. • May be in a fixed location or move as work progresses. • May be more than one work area within a work zone. It is still considered a work area when work has temporarily stopped yet the highway has not returned to its normal operation conditions. Every effort should be made to minimize hazards and distractions to drivers and workers. See the requirements of Regulation 213/91 under the OHSA. 3.4.6 Termination Area The termination area is an area where traffic makes the transition back to the normal path of a highway. They extend from the downstream end of the work area to the point where traffic is able to resume normal driving, typically at the end of the delineation of the termination taper on multi-lane divided highways, or at the TC-2 in the opposing direction of an undivided highway. 3.4.7 Additional Considerations in Component Area Design 3.4.7.1 Ingress and Egress Ingress to, and egress from, the work zone should be set up to ensure safety of workers and highway users and have minimal impact on traffic flow. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 3 35 SECTION 3 The following considerations should be made during design: • Ensure sufficient gaps are available in the traffic flow for ingress and egress of work vehicles.

    • Coordination of deliveries (i.e., arranging deliveries for off-peak hours if congestion is an
    

    issue).
    

• Provide adequate deceleration/acceleration lanes for work vehicles that are entering/ exiting the travelled lane, and ensuring they are free of obstructions and/or workers. • Maintain driver expectancy by: ⚪ Providing sufficient direction to motorists. ⚪ Allowing for adequate sight distances, accounting for curves and obstructions. ⚪ Including sufficient traffic control devices and lighting, so that drivers will not follow vehicles into the work area. The following considerations should be made during construction: • Using a TCP to control work vehicles entering/exiting the work area. ⚪ A TCP may stop public traffic and/or work vehicles to protect work vehicles crossing or entering a highway where the NPRS is less than or equal to 60 km/hr. ⚪ Where the NPRS is greater than 60 km/h, TCP may control work vehicles entering/ crossing only, not public traffic. • Widening the spacing between markers in the termination area or extend across only one

    lane (in the termination of a multiple lane closure) so that ingress/egress of work vehicles
    

will not be hindered. • Ensuring the following: ⚪ All equipment, vehicles, and employee parking remain clear of areas where trucks need to enter or exit the work zone. ⚪ Openings that are not in use are closed off. ⚪ Channelizing devices are regularly checked, and traffic observed for indications of confusion. ⚪ Dynamic signs approved by the road authority are being used. 3.4.7.2 Linear Space Restrictions There may be situations where, due to linear space restrictions, the recommended lengths for the component areas cannot be achieved as shown in the layouts. However, linear space restrictions TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 336 SECTION 3 do not justify any failure to use enough warning and channelizing devices as required for public protection and guidance, or for protection of workers. In urban low speed areas, characterized by closely spaced intersections and/or many driveways and entrances within the available linear space, the following modifications may be considered: • Reducing taper lengths to the minimum shown below in Table 3.6. Table 3.6 Linear Space Restrictions in Urban Non-freeway Areas Urban Non-freeway with Linear Space Restrictions

    Normal Posted Regulatory Speed (NPRS) Limit
    

50 km/h 60 km/h 70 km/h

    Taper Length for Full Lane Closure (m) 30 40 60
    

• Shortening or eliminating the termination area. • Reducing the advance warning area. All advance signs must be placed ahead of the approach area. • Relocating the taper and buffer areas upstream of the intervening obstruction. • Reducing or eliminating the LBA. The LBA length is derived such that the taper plus the LBA length are greater than the stopping sight distance. In such cases, additional advance warning and delineation devices should be considered. Reducing or eliminating an LBA should only be undertaken once alternatives, such as relocating the taper and buffer areas upstream of the intervening restriction, have been considered and deemed impractical. Section 3.4.4 describes conditions under which an LBA is not required. • In situations where, even with the elimination of the LBA, it is necessary to reduce taper lengths in the transition area, additional traffic control devices, such as a TC-12 flashing arrow board or reduced barrel spacing should be used. On rural low volume highways, where low volume is defined as less than 3,000 vehicles/day total in both directions, the minimum taper length for highway closures may be reduced as shown below in Table 3.7. +NOTE Volumes may be obtained from the road authority. Alternatively, a count can be taken of vehicles traveling in both directions during a 3-minute period. Less than 10 vehicles correspond to less than 3,000 vehicles/day.

    On freeways, where a Crash Truck (CT) is required, linear space restrictions are less likely to arise.
    

Where they may arise, however, is when working in the vicinity of interchange ramps. In this case, consideration should be given to: • Lengthening the taper and/or LBA. • Bringing the start of the taper further upstream. • Closing the interchange ramps. If these options are not feasible, and some reduction in linear dimension cannot be avoided, the LBA should be reduced in conjunction with a reduction in the length of the taper. In this case: • Additional active advance warning devices must be used. • The LIDG between the Crash Truck and the work area should not be reduced.

    • The taper should not be reduced by more than 50% of its normal length (see Table C).
    

Under such conditions, the use of a CT or other protection/attenuation device along with additional advance warning and guidance devices, must be in accordance with the guidelines outlined in Section 4. 3.4.7.3 Horizontal and Vertical Clearance Workers and/or equipment must not be positioned on the outboard side of cones or delineators. Consideration must be given to: • Providing sufficient horizontal clearance within the delineation of the work area to contain all work and/or equipment on or above ground, including elevated equipment such as bucket trucks used for work under bridge structures and overhead wires. • Height variances across the lane/shoulders and the effect of super-elevation on tall

    vehicles (i.e., tractor trailers) on the travelled lane through the work zone.
    

3.5 Duration of Work Duration of work is a major factor in determining the number and types of signs and devices, and the way they are used, in temporary work zones. The five categories of work duration used in Book 7 are: TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 338 SECTION 3

1.  Mobile Operations.
2.  Intermittent Duration (ID).
3.  Very Short Duration (VSD).
4.  Short Duration (SD).
5.  Long Duration (LD). Categories 2 to 5 are used for stationary operations. Required component lengths and device spacing are treated differently for non-freeways and freeways as there is a greater expectation by drivers for smooth, uninterrupted traffic flow on freeways. Table A, Table B, and Table C in Section 6 provide appropriate distances and are laid out as follows:

    • Table A: Non-Freeways (Mobile, ID, and VSD work).
    

    • Table B: Non-Freeways (SD and LD work).
    

    • Table C: Freeways (Mobile, ID, VSD, SD, and LD work).
    

3.5.1 Mobile Operations

    Definition:
    

Mobile operations involve work that is done while continuously moving, usually

    at low speeds (typically 5 to 30 km/h). +NOTE
    

Mobile operations may have: • Periodic brief stops, related to the mobile activity. • Stops do not exceed a few minutes in duration. • No planned work to take place outside the work vehicle. If a brief stop is required at a predetermined specific location, it is considered ID or VSD work rather than a mobile operation. During mobile operations, the advanced warning area moves with the activity area. Devices Required: Where volume is light, and visibility is good: • A well-marked, well-signed vehicle may be enough. Where volume and/or speeds are higher: • A BV equipped with a flashing arrow board should follow the work vehicle. Mobile Operations involve work that is done while continuously moving, usually at low speeds. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 3 39 SECTION 3 • Work vehicles must have at minimum, four-way flashers and an amber 360-degree beacon

    device (4WF/360°). A 360-degree beacon directs intense light continuously through
    

all 360 degrees of the compass and must complete a full rotation every 1.5 seconds. Alternatively, rotating LED amber lights can be used in place of 4WF plus 360-degree beacon device. • The vehicles may also be equipped with truck-mounted attenuators, and appropriate signs, as illustrated in the layouts.

    Where mobile operations occur in a travelled lane of a multi-lane divided high-speed highway (NPRS
    

    70 km/h or greater), flashing arrow boards must be used.
    

    Examples:
    

Examples of mobile operations include: • Zone painting. • Street sweeping. • Longitudinal pavement marking.

    Paving operations are a very low speed type of mobile operation; so low that layouts are those used
    

for stationary operations. Specific requirements for paving operations are described in Section 4.

    3.5.2 Intermittent Duration Work (ID)
    

    Definition:
    

ID work occupies a fixed location for 15 minutes or less, including the time it takes to set up and remove traffic control devices. • The work site may be moved along the highway and make frequent and short stops where planned work takes place outside of the work vehicle. • If a short stop of less than 15 minutes is required at a specific location, it is ID work rather than a Mobile Operation. • If a worker is to be exposed to traffic for more than 15 minutes, including the time required to set up traffic control devices and work time, then a greater protection is required and traffic control layouts for VSD work should be used. Devices Required: Active devices, such as flashing arrow boards and simplified setup and removal procedures are recommended for ID work, which help to ensure: +NOTE • Adequate traffic control. • Reduction in the time that the worker is exposed to traffic hazards. Intermittent duration work occupies a fixed location for 15 minutes or less. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 340 SECTION 3 • More efficient and productive work operations.

    Examples:
    

Examples of ID work include: • Pothole patching. • Surveying. • Dead animal removal. • Minor debris pickup.

    3.5.3 Very Short Duration Work (VSD)
    

    Definition:
    

VSD work occupies a fixed location for 30 minutes or less, but more than 15 minutes including the time it takes to set up and remove traffic control devices. The work site may be moved along the highway and make frequent and short stops where planned work takes place outside of the work vehicle. If a short stop is required at a specific location, it is VSD work rather than a Mobile Operation. If a worker is to be exposed to traffic for more than 30 minutes, including the time required to set up traffic control devices and work time, then a greater protection is required and traffic control layouts for SD work should be used.

    Devices:
    

Active devices such as flashing arrow boards, simplified set up and removal procedures, and rolling closures are recommended for VSD work and help to

    ensure: +NOTE
    

• Adequate traffic control. • Reduction in the time that the worker is exposed to traffic hazards. • More efficient and productive work operations.

    Examples:
    

Examples of VSD work include: • Some utility works. • Minor highway maintenance. • Pothole patching. • Surveying. • Stormwater catch basin cleanout. Very short duration work occupies a fixed location for 30 minutes or less. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 3 41 SECTION 3

    3.5.4 Short Duration Work (SD)
    

    Definition:
    

SD work refers to activities that require work areas that are continuously occupied by workers and/or equipment for more than 30 minutes but less than one 24-hour period in duration. SD work does not generally include work at a

    site that extends beyond 24 hours; such work is LD. However, work at the same
    

location may extend over more than one day, and still be considered SD work for the purpose of traffic control device layout, if all of the following conditions are

    met:
    

1.  The approval of the road authority is obtained. The road authority may consider that LD work is more appropriate for recurring lane closures. +NOTE
2.  Any additional conditions stipulated by the road authority, including working hours, are complied with.
3.  Continuous work is less than 24 hours.
4.  The highway (and sidewalk) are restored to the satisfaction of the road authority and

    returned to normal operation when the daily work shift (or authorized working period) is
    

complete.

    3.5.5 Long Duration Work (LD)
    

    Definition:
    

LD work refers to activities which require a work area for longer than 24 hours. Longer exposure of workers and highway users requires more positive guidance through a temporary condition.

    Devices:
    

Temporary highways and barriers may be provided, and inappropriate markings which cause driver confusion should be removed and replaced with temporary markings. +NOTE For stationary operations on freeways longer than five days in duration,

    temporary construction barrier systems (TCBS) are required, as required by
    

Ontario Regulation 213/91, Section 67 under the OSHA. For minimal working widths, TCBS either do not deflect or have minimal deflection. TCBS are designed and crash tested for placement on paved surfaces. Short duration work occupies a fixed location for more than 30 minutes but less than 24 hours. NOTE Long duration work occupies a fixed location for more than 24 hours. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 342 SECTION 3 3.6 Speed Management in Temporary Work Zones Managing compliance with NPRS, or reduced speed limits within a work zone is necessary for both highway user and worker safety. Measures that may be considered to be effective in helping to manage speeds and increase compliance with posted speeds in work zones include:

1.  Police presence with enforcement in the work zone. • Most effective. • Provisions should be made to assist police to find a location to set up for enforcement in the constrained confines of a construction site.
2.  Establishing a designated construction zone to double the speed fines when workers are present. • The effect of this measure is enhanced with the presence of police and enforcement.
3.  Use of active devices to encourage compliance.

    • Variable Message Signs (VMS) can be used to inform users of temporary conditions
    

ahead that require them to slow down. • Speed display signs, where the speed of drivers is measured by radar and displayed to the driver on a VMS can be installed. • When drivers see their speeds displayed: ⚪ Some may be genuinely surprised that they are travelling that fast and may reduce their speeds. ⚪ Other drivers may be uncertain as to whether a sign that shows their speed means that enforcement is nearby and may reduce speed to avoid a potential fine. • The effect of a single VMS in a long work zone may be reduced with

    distance from the sign; therefore, multiple VMS may be required to
    

sustain a speed reduction. +NOTE • This measure will have lasting effectiveness only if supported by periodic police enforcement.

    • Refer to OTM Book 10 (Dynamic Message Signs) for guidelines on the
    

safe placement of VMS and manufacturer guidelines to ensure accurate readings. • VMS should not be used for one lane of a multi-lane highway as there is the potential for increased speed variance. • Road authority approval and enforcement consultation should be obtained prior to the use of speed display signs. Speed display VMS should not be used for one lane of a multi-lane highway. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 3 43 SECTION 3 4. Use of pilot vehicles, pace vehicles or rolling closures. • See Section 4 for speed reductions for specific periods of time or specific work operations. 5. Posting of reduced speed limits through either:

    a) Installation of advisory speed limit signs (orange and black, non-enforceable)
    

    together with narrower highways or lanes through the work area; or
    

    b) Installation of regulatory speed limit signs (black and white, requires
    

    establishing a designated construction zone).
    

Table 3.8 provides speed management methods and devices, including their potential effectiveness at reducing operating speeds and increasing driver alertness. Table 3.8 Potential Effectiveness of Speed Management Methods Speed Management Method/Device Potential Effectiveness at: Reducing Operating Speeds Increasing Driver Alertness Speed Limit Reduction Regulatory speed reduction, no enforcement ◔ ◔ Regulatory speed reduction, periodic enforcement ◑ ◔ Regulatory speed reduction, constant police presence ● ● Advisory speed reduction ◔ ◔ With or Without Speed Limit Reduction Police presence ● ● Lane narrowing using channelization devices ◑ ◑ PVMS ◑ ◑ Speed radar and display ◑ ◑ Temporary rumble strips ◔ ◑ Pilot vehicles ● ● Pace vehicles ● ● Legend TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 344 SECTION 3 ● Most effective ◑ Shown to be reasonably effective ◔ Shown to have little effect 3.6.1 Guidelines for Posting Reduced Speed Limits in Construction Zones Highway work zones must be designed around the basic principles of:

1.  Worker safety.
2.  Highway user safety.
3.  Highway user mobility. Improving highway user safety also improves worker safety since traffic crashes often put workers at risk. Research has shown that simply reducing the speed limit can negatively impact work zone safety by increasing speed differentials and crash risk. Therefore, the following guidelines should be followed:

    • A Traffic Management Plan (TMP) should be developed for each project in accordance
    

with Section 2. In developing the TMP, a comprehensive safety risk review should be conducted along with a hierarchical approach to work zone safety, starting with more conservative and effective measures than speed limit reduction. Greater separation of vehicles from workers, protective barriers or other risk reduction strategies should be implemented as part of the Traffic Management Plan. • The travelled way through a work zone should be designed for an operating speed that is equal to or as close as possible to the design speed of the approaches to the work zone. If a speed limit reduction is deemed necessary, road authorities have the option of using advisory signs or reducing the regulatory speed limit, either temporarily or continuously through a construction zone. Table 3.9 provides examples of the appropriate uses of each method. Both regulatory and advisory speed limit signs can be used on different portions of the same contract for severe work zone conditions. The police and road authorities should discuss logistics of enforcement and speed control. • Regulatory and advisory speed reductions should not be more than 20 km/h below the normal posted speed. Speed limit reductions of 20 km/h or less have been shown to be more effective than larger reductions at minimizing speed variance and crash risk. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 3 45 SECTION 3 • Speed reductions are more likely to be obeyed by motorists if they are perceived as necessary. +NOTE The reason for the speed reduction should be provided through advance signage and repeated as necessary. When reduced regulatory speed limits are used for temporary worker

    safety (as described in Table 3.9), signs must be covered or removed, and
    

the NPRS must be restored when workers are not present. The speed reduction must move with the active operation and there must be visible signs of work activity. • Regulatory speed limit signs shall only be installed when approved by the road authority. Once approved, the appropriate police authority must be notified of the regulatory speed change prior to installation. • Regulatory speed reductions should be at least 300 metres in length, even if the work zone is less than 300 metres. Speed reductions can be implemented in stages. On a divided highway, the road authority may permit different speed limits for each direction of travel. In the case of an express/ collector freeway, the speed limit may be lowered on one highway, but not on the other. The following table presents the appropriate use of advisory or regulatory speed limit signage when posting reduced speed limits in construction zones. Table 3.9 Posting of Reduced Speed Limits in Construction Zones: Appropriate Use of Advisory or Regulatory Speed Limit Signs Method Examples of where speed limit reductions should be

    considered:
    

Required Approval Advisory Speed Limits: • Used whenever an unexpected change in geometrics is caused by the work activity. • Bumps. • Low shoulders. • Drop-offs. • Limited, but not substandard, sight lines or stopping sight distances. • Limited, but not substandard, horizontal or vertical alignment.

    • Gravel surfaces (less
    

than 500 metres in

    length).
    

• Temporary lane closures. • Milled surfaces. • As required by the road authority. • For provincial highways, with agreement of the regional Traffic office. Speed reductions are more likely to be obeyed by motorists if they are perceived as necessary. NPRS must be restored when workers are not present. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 346 SECTION 3 Method Examples of where speed limit reductions should be

    considered:
    

Required Approval Regulatory Speed Limits: • Used for temporary,

    worker safety; only to
    

be used when workers present. • Where workers on a freeway are within 3.0 metres of a travelled lane that is open to traffic and where no barrier is

    used (see Section 4).
    

• Where workers on a non-freeway with NPRS greater than or equal to 70 km/h are within 3.0 metres of a travelled lane that is open to traffic and where no barrier is

    used (see Section 4).
    

• Where workers on a non- freeway with NPRS less than 70 km/h are within 1.5 metres of a travelled lane that is open to traffic where no barrier is used

    (see Section 4).
    

• Approval by the road authority is required. • For provincial highways, approval by regional Traffic using: ⚪ Designation of Construction Zone form and Justification Report outlining the rationale for the

    speed reduction; or,
    

• As per Special Provisions in the contract. Regulatory Speed Limits: • Used for continuous public and worker safety

    on Long Duration (LD)
    

construction when workers are present 24

    hours per day; or,
    

• Used for highway user safety due to continuous hazards, or where uninterrupted flow cannot be designed at or above the normal regulatory posted speed

    (substandard geometrics).
    

• Where lane width is less than 3.5 metres on freeways or less than 3.0 metres on non-freeways. • Where shoulder width or offset to barriers is less than 0.5 metres, on one or both sides. • Where there is sudden lane narrowing. • Where there are substandard sight lines or stopping sight distances. • Approval by the road authority is required. • For provincial highways, approval by regional Traffic using: ⚪ Designation of Construction Zone form and Justification Report outlining the rationale for the

    speed reduction; or,
    

• As per Special Provisions in the contract. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 3 47 SECTION 3 Method Examples of where speed limit reductions should be

    considered:
    

Required Approval • Where there are multiple lane shifts, detours or transitions designed at less than the normal posted speed limit, or those with no illumination. • Where there is substandard horizontal or vertical alignment. • Where there are multiple lane shifts with overlapping/confusing pavement markings. • Where there are partial lane shifts onto a surface texture different from the main highway.

    • Gravel surfaces (greater
    

than 500 metres in

    length).
    

3.6.2 Designating the Construction Zone Designated construction zones are established by the road authority in order to: • Reduce the regulatory speed limit. • Enforce the legislation on doubled speed fines. The road authority may delegate a senior staff member who will: • Designate the construction zone. • Set the speed limit. • Ensure that records are kept with details on when a speed limit Is changed. Contractors do not have the authority to establish designated construction zones. Only MTO can establish designated construction zones on provincial highways. To reduce the regulatory speed limit or to enforce the legislation on doubled speed fines, the road authority must establish a designated construction zone. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 348 SECTION 3

    The Highway Traffic Act (HTA) requires that a designated construction zone must be clearly marked
    

with standard:

    • Rb-90A “CONSTRUCTION ZONE BEGINS” sign; and,
    

• Rb-90B “CONSTRUCTION ZONE ENDS” sign found in Regulation 615 of the Act, and in Section 4. Reduced speed limits become enforceable once the required signs are posted. Limits of the designated construction zone should be selected such that there is enough room within the zone to accommodate all signs except for: • TC-1, TC-1A, TC-1B, TC-5, TC-5A, TC-5B, and the information signs in advance of these. See TG-1, TG-2, UG-1, UG-2, DG-1, DG-2, FG-1, FG-2 for designated construction zones and reduced speed limit signage. Rules that govern speed limits in designated construction zones, and the doubling of speeding fines in a construction zone when workers are present are detailed in Bill 169 of the Transportation Statute Law Amendment Act, 2005, which received Royal Assent on November 21, 2005. 3.6.3 Turn Prohibitions and Other Regulations in the Construction Zone Under some circumstances, it may be necessary to: • Prohibit turns, especially left turns, in a construction zone that passes through a major intersection in order to maintain adequate traffic flow. The regulations may be part- time or full-time, depending on the nature of the traffic volume, and should be formal and enacted through the regulatory process, in order to be enforceable. Transit or other exceptions may be required. • Ban parking that approaches a construction zone to ensure traffic control devices are visible and enough space is available for the transition area. Appropriate approvals must be obtained from the road authority. For provincial highways, regional Traffic Office approval of the PHM-125 drawing is required for all temporary signals, including any revision to the PHM-125 drawing, prior to implementation. For any revision to permanent signals, provincial Traffic Office approval is required prior to implementation. 3.7 Active Road User Considerations Safety of pedestrians, cyclists and other active road users must be addressed in all temporary traffic control layouts where they are, or may be, present. Temporary traffic control plans include BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 3 49 SECTION 3

    accommodation for active road users unless they are always expressly prohibited (i.e. on a freeway).
    

Active road users should be considered for each construction phase. 3.7.1 Pedestrian Safety Considerations Pedestrians should be provided with a safe, convenient, and clearly delineated travel path that

    ensures:
    

• Exposure to potential hazards is minimized. • Pedestrians are not led into direct conflicts with: ⚪ Work site vehicles, equipment, or operations. ⚪ Mainline traffic that is moving through or around the work site.

    • The characteristics of the existing sidewalk(s) or footpath(s) are replicated as closely as
    

possible. • Pedestrians are guided to, through, and from work sites in a clear and positive manner. • Pedestrian movements are inhibited as little as possible. • The pedestrian travel path and pedestrian traffic control are compliant with the

    Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA). For example:
    

⚪ A minimum sidewalk or path width of 1.8 m is preferred in areas where accessibility may become an issue for two wheelchairs passing one another. ⚪ The needs of visually impaired pedestrians shall also be considered, as a construction site can be challenging to safely and comfortably traverse. Existing travel patterns should be observed and/or a meeting with the local community be held to determine the extent of accommodation required. Additional pedestrian accommodations are indicated with the presence of:

    • Significant pedestrian generators (e.g. schools, community centers).
    

    • A significant number of vulnerable pedestrians (seniors, children, disabled, etc.).
    

• Transit routes, stops, and intermodal transfer points.

    • Well-traveled pedestrian routes (e.g. signed trails, links between pedestrian origins and
    

    destinations).
    

Pedestrian traffic control devices should be routinely inspected and are not to be used for the control or channelization of moving vehicular traffic. Temporary pedestrian accommodation must be compliant with the AODA. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 350 SECTION 3 3.7.1.1 Pedestrian Protection from the Work Zone Pedestrians must be protected from all potential hazards associated with the work zone. These hazards and potential mitigations include: • Equipment and moving vehicles ⚪ Place barricades to separate pedestrians from moving traffic and/or a work area, as described in Section 4.

    ⚪ Use temporary construction barrier system (TCBS) where high speed or volumes of
    

vehicles may present greater risk. ⚪ Do not use mesh fencing, caution tape, cones, or other materials which do not provide positive pedestrian protection. ⚪ Provide construction vehicle ingress/egress signs visible to pedestrians. • Trenches and excavations

    ⚪ Use temporary construction barrier system (TCBS) to prevent pedestrians from falling
    

into open excavations. ⚪ Do not use pedestrian barricades for excavations more than 2.4 m in depth. ⚪ Refer to O. Reg. 213/91 for more information on trenches and excavations requirements. • Tripping hazards from debris or uneven surfaces ⚪ Provide night-time illumination where existing is not sufficient. ⚪ Avoid the use of material that may result in slippery walkway surfaces. ⚪ Regularly inspect path for debris and potential for tripping. ⚪ Provide curb ramps meeting AODA standards. ⚪ Where provided, railing should be sturdy, firm to grip, and smooth. Refer to O. Reg. 413/12 for more information on handrails. • Obstructions to their path ⚪ Provide an obstruction-free path of consistent width wherever possible. ⚪ Clearly mark any obstructions, especially at night. • Overhead hazards such as falling material or overhead work ⚪ Use covered walkways for work being carried out at 4.5 m or less from a public walkway. ⚪ Refer to O. Reg. 213/91 for more information on public way protection. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 3 51 SECTION 3 Other hazards may be present: positive protection for pedestrians must be identified in the Traffic Management Plan and be provided for each hazard. 3.7.1.2 Pedestrian Travel Path In comparison to other travel modes walking requires considerable effort so pedestrian travel paths through work zones should minimize detours and eliminate backtracking. Pedestrians may otherwise be tempted to take dangerous ‘shortcuts’ across or along traffic and through an active work zone. In order of preference: • Keep sidewalks open while providing protection from the work zone.

    • If a sidewalk must be closed, provide a parallel diversion route (which
    

    may require temporary parking removal, ramps or paths).+NOTE
    

• If a parallel diversion route is not feasible, provide a detour route which minimizes additional time and distance. As shown in TS-23, TI-17, US-30, UI-29, DS-22, and DI-29, place TC-40 and other sidewalk signs at upstream intersections where an alternate route is available, rather than mid-block. Guidance to pedestrians should be positive and clear.

    • Install barricades (such as TC-53) or channelization which are
    

continuous longitudinally. The top of a pedestrian barricade shall be located at a minimum of 1.0 metre above the surface on which it is installed. +NOTE • Install directional and informational signage specifically for pedestrians. Signage should be repeated in advance, transition and work areas. • Provide sufficient illumination levels, from permanent and/or temporary lighting, to allow pedestrians to be safely guided through the temporary path. Pedestrian paths through work areas must comply with AODA requirements and should be designed considering local usage. • Minimum sidewalk or path widths for pedestrians should be 1.2 metres. Minimum

    widths should be increased (1.8 m) in areas with vulnerable pedestrians (seniors,
    

    disabled, families with strollers and small children) or large numbers of pedestrians (e.g.
    

    commercial or school areas). Multi-Use Paths accommodating both pedestrians and
    

cyclists should be at least 3.0 m wide. • Barricades or channelization should have continuous detectible edging at bottom and top to be detectable by cane. Provide pedestrian travel paths which replicate original conditions as closely as possible. NOTE Pedestrians must be provided with a safe, convenient, and clearly delineated travel path. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 352 SECTION 3

    • All AODA path geometry requirements (ramps, slope, etc.) must be met on temporary
    

paths. Accessible ramps must be provided between a closed sidewalk and a diversion route on the roadway. • Temporary path material must not cause a hazard to pedestrians using mobility aids or having vision loss. • Other temporary conditions or situations, such as modified rail grade crossings, should be appropriately demarcated. Pedestrian traffic control devices must be routinely inspected and are not to be used for the control or channelization of moving vehicular traffic. 3.7.1.3 Temporary Pedestrian Crossings Pedestrian crossing facilities may be affected by temporary conditions. • All temporary traffic signals shall include pedestrian signal heads if present in the

    permanent installation. The same AODA requirements (detectable, audible, location
    

    relative to sidewalk, etc.) shall be maintained where they are present in the permanent
    

installation.

    • Sightlines to and from all pedestrian crossings (permanent or temporary) must be
    

maintained through all stages of construction. Motorists must be able to see pedestrians at the curb waiting to cross, particularly at Pedestrian Crossovers and school crossings. Pedestrians must be able to see traffic from all directions, including turning vehicles.

    • Trail crossings (controlled, uncontrolled, or grade-separated) should be accommodated
    

through temporary crossings or detours. Advance signage on trails should be provided. • Other temporary conditions or situations, such as modified rail grade crossings, should be appropriately demarcated. In some work zones it may be advisable to create a temporary crossing facility as an alternative to

    a closed crossing. OTM Book 15 (Pedestrian Crossing Facilities) should be consulted to determine
    

appropriate type and design requirements. 3.7.1.4 Pedestrian Access Within Work Zones Pedestrians require access to destinations within and adjacent to the work zone. Considerations may

    include:
    

• Transit stops and routes. ⚪ Provide safe access to and from existing transit stop locations whenever possible. ⚪ Coordinate the relocation or removal of transit stops. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 3 53 SECTION 3 ⚪ Maintain existing transit routes by providing sufficient lane widths and turning radii whenever possible. ⚪ Coordinate with transit agencies to provide advance and ongoing notification of stop or route changes to users. • Buildings/businesses ⚪ Maintain continuous pedestrian access to all buildings, especially businesses, if possible. ⚪ Stage work as required to allow access from at least one direction. ⚪ Provide informational signage indicating access routes and that businesses are open, as well as ingress/egress signage. ⚪ Place Traffic Control Persons to indicate when pedestrians can enter safely. 3.7.2 Cyclist Safety Considerations Cyclist safety considerations must be explicitly considered in all work zones, except where bicycles are legally prohibited, as they have the same right to safe passage as motor vehicles under the HTA. These principles should be followed: • Modify conditions on the roadways which create hazards specifically for cyclists. • Provide traffic control and delineation considering cyclist requirements. • Maintain the same type of cycling facility if possible. In some municipalities there are by-laws requiring that cyclists be accommodated. • Provide advance notice in time and space of unexpected conditions, as delays and restrictions may be more problematic for cyclists than for motor vehicle users. When assessing options for the treatment of the cyclists through a work zone, a practitioner should

    consider:
    

• The volume of cyclists using the route. • Who is using the route, such as children going to school. • The importance of the route in the cycling network/the availability of alternate routes. • The operating speed and traffic volumes of the roadway. • The length and timeframe of the closure or disruption, including the season. • Whether there will be unavoidable disruptions to the grade or surface quality of the roadway as part of the work. • Whether the route is signed and/or mapped as a designated cycling facility. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 354 SECTION 3 Designated cycling facilities are of the following types, from greatest to least level of separation: • Off road trails.

    • In-boulevard Multi-Use Paths (MUP).
    

• Physically separated cycling lanes. • Cycle tracks.

    • Bicycle lanes (buffered, conventional and advisory).
    

• Paved shoulders. • Neighbourhood bikeways.

    • Shared roadway (side by side, or single file).
    

    Complete description of bicycle facilities and their selection is found in OTM Book 18 (Cycling
    

    Facilities), for non-provincial highways and the MTO Bikeways Design Manual for provincial highways.
    

3.7.2.1 Cyclist Protection in the Work Zone Some conditions may pose hazards to cyclists but not to motorists. These hazards and potential mitigations include: Excavations and moving equipment • Conditions in the boulevard or adjacent to a paved shoulder may pose a greater risk to cyclists. • A temporary construction barrier shall be considered when there is a drop-off, trench, or moving equipment within 1.0 m of the edge of the pavement or the active transportation facility. Do not use mesh fencing, caution tape, cones, or other materials which do not provide positive cyclist protection. • Barriers or sturdy fencing used for the protection of cyclists should be at least 1.8 m high so that cyclists or other members of public do not fall over them. • Traffic Control Persons allowing construction vehicle or equipment movement should explicitly control cyclists if a designated facility or significant cyclist volumes are present. Surface conditions Safe cycling requires a higher standard of travel surface than motor vehicle operation. When a cyclist is directed through the work zone, the following considerations must be given to surface conditions. • Providing a smooth, hard travel surface. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 3 55 SECTION 3 Safe cycling requires a higher standard of travel surface than for a motor vehicle. NOTE⚪ Asphalt is ideal, but a compacted granular surface is acceptable for temporary use if well-maintained. ⚪ Avoid loose gravel, compacted aggregate, sand, mud, and standing water. ⚪ Sweep surfaces regularly, especially the outer 2.0 metres of the curb lane.

    • Ensure that temporary surfaces (e.g., steel plates, timber decking) are skid-resistant with
    

smooth joints at right angles to the travel path. • Minimize vertical discontinuities. Where cycling volumes are high and discontinuities are

    unavoidable (e.g., at road cuts, raised ironworks, steel plates that are not recessed into the
    

    pavement), consider mitigating them with asphalt ramps. Use reflective paint and place
    

    devices (such as barriers, barrels, or cones) to direct cyclists away from un-ramped grade
    

changes. • Cyclists may need additional lateral clearance when the cycling surface is rough. If so, consider providing a separate bike lane rather than a shared lane through the work zone. • Use signs to notify cyclists of any variance from a smooth asphalt condition, where appropriate. Obstructions • Provide an obstruction-free path wherever possible.

    • Ensure that signs do not intrude into the travel path of cyclists; if intrusion is unavoidable,
    

maximize sign visibility. Alternating one-way traffic flow Consideration should be given to the lower speed of cyclists to enable them to safely clear the work zone when a single lane bi-directional temporary condition is controlled by Traffic Control Persons

    (TCP) or temporary signals.
    

• TCP should communicate to each other about the presence of cyclists in the work zone. • The timing of temporary signals should consider the time required for cyclists to travel through the work zone. Cyclist operating speed used to calculate clearance time should

    consider:
    

⚪ Surface treatment. ⚪ Available lines of sight. ⚪ Existence of potential areas of refuge for cyclists in the work zone. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 356 SECTION 3 3.7.2.2 Modified/Temporary Cycling Facility If a work zone in or adjacent to a cycling facility is required, every effort should be made to minimize disruption to the facility. Generally, the level of separation provided during temporary conditions should be consistent with the original infrastructure. If the cycling facility is a physically separated bikeway, it is recommended that physical separation from traffic be maintained through the temporary facility. Separate cycling facilities

    Types of separate cycling facilities are off road trails, in-boulevard Multi-Use Paths (MUP), physically
    

    separated cycling lanes, cycle tracks, bicycle lanes (buffered or conventional) and designated paved
    

shoulders for cycling. • In constrained conditions, the cycling facility may be narrowed to create a minimum operating space of 1.5 m between physical barriers, or 1.2 m between painted lines. • The alignment of MUP, cycle tracks, bicycle lanes or paved shoulders

    may be diverted within the right of way, if required (Example layouts are
    

    shown in TS-24, TS-25, US-31, US-32, DS-23, DS-24).
    

• If a lateral realignment is required, a 6:1 taper of the cycling facility is recommended to avoid abrupt changes in direction for cyclists. • Where a cycling lane must taper towards motor vehicle lanes, practitioners should assess the risk of vehicles infringing on the cycle lane and consider the use of physical protection

    such as barrels (TC-54), flexible bollards (TC-52) or TCBS.
    

• Any barriers separating cycling facilities and motor vehicle lanes should not be higher than 0.6 m high, so cyclists remain visible to drivers. • Ensure that alignment changes through intersections do not compromise required sightlines to/from motorists and cyclists. Mixed traffic operation

    Mixed traffic operation includes designated Shared Roads (side by side, or single file), neighbourhood
    

bikeways and advisory bicycle lanes. • Preserve an acceptable shared lane width through the work zone: ⚪ Side by side shared lanes should be at least 4.3 m wide to accommodate HTA requirements for drivers to maintain at least 1.0 m separation from cyclists. ⚪ Single file lanes should be wide enough to accommodate the expected vehicular traffic. Narrowing of motor vehicle lanes where feasible should be prioritized over narrowing of the cycling lane. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 3 57 SECTION 3 ⚪ A two-way centre travel lane width between 4.0 and 5.0 m with advisory bicycle lanes is not recommended. • Notify cyclists of any reduction in shared lane width in the work zone and reaffirm the shared lane condition by posting temporary condition Share the Road signs. • Consider removing on-street parking, or providing a cyclist detour, if reduced shared lane

    width requires cyclists to travel within 0.6 m of parked cars (1.0 m is preferred).
    

3.7.2.3 Change in Cyclist Facility Type If cyclist traffic through the work zone cannot be accommodated using appropriate modifications to the original facilities, the type of cyclist facility provided can be changed. Only facilities appropriate for the posted speed, average daily traffic and context should be used. OTM Book 18 and MTO Bikeways Design Manual provides nomographs for urban/suburban and rural contexts which show desirable cycling facilities. Conversion to shared roadway Separate cycling facilities can be temporarily converted to shared roadway in some circumstances and with appropriate signage. • A temporary shared roadway may be used if the posted speed is no greater than 40 km/h in urban/suburban context or if the average

    daily traffic volume is no greater than 1000 vehicles (at 60 km/h) in
    

a rural context, as per facility selection from OTM Book 18 and MTO Bikeways Design Manual.

    • Use Bicycle Lane Ends sign (TC-43) and temporary condition Share
    

    the Road or Single File signs (Example layouts are shown in TS-27,
    

    US-34, DS-26). Apply distance tabs in advance of cycling facility
    

closure, where appropriate. • If a Single File shared lane is the only traveled lane in that direction consider prohibiting motor vehicles from passing cyclists. Diversion to adjacent sidewalk or pathway In certain work zone conditions, it is appropriate to divert cyclists onto an adjacent sidewalk or pathway.

    • A temporary Multi-Use Path (MUP) can be created if the pedestrian facility is wide enough
    

    (3.0 m or greater) to accommodate both cyclist and pedestrian volumes (Example layouts
    

    are shown in TS-26, US-33, DS-25).
    

Temporary cyclist facility type should be selected using OTM Book 18 and MTO Bikeways Design Manual nomographs. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 358 SECTION 3 • Appropriate signage for both cyclists and pedestrians, tapers and temporary ramps from the roadway to temporary MUP must be

    provided. Sidewalk railings adjacent to hazards (e.g., on bridges) may
    

require modification to achieve a minimum height of 1.5 m. • For closures over very short distances, it may be acceptable to instruct cyclists to dismount and walk on the pedestrian facility. In some instances, this may be more beneficial to the cyclist than providing a

    detour. (Example layouts are shown in TI-19, UI-31, DI-31).
    

3.7.2.4 Cyclist Detours Detours and alternative routes should be provided when on-route accommodations are not possible. Detours do not require special signage for cyclists unless it is a bicycle-specific detour. • All roadways on the detour route should already be designated cycling facilities or

    appropriate for the cycling facilities to be provided, as per OTM Book 18 (Cycling Facilities)
    

and MTO Bikeways Design Manual.

    • Provide early notice of projects that could cause significant inconvenience to cyclists (e.g.,
    

    long detours), making use of cyclist organizations or user groups where available.
    

• Cyclist detour signage provides both advance notice of the detour and guidance along the

    detour route. (Example layouts are shown in TI-18, UI-30, DI-30).
    

3.8 Visibility Considerations A well-planned and executed traffic control set up effectively communicates information to drivers passing through the work area. Communication is achieved through the placement of signs and devices appropriate for the desired action the driver must take to safely move around the work area. Visibility of signs and devices in the work area is, therefore, a critical factor to be considered when planning and installing effective traffic control measures. 3.8.1 Night-time Provisions For planned night-time work operations, the following provisions must be considered for maximum visibility through the work zone:

1.  For night-time work of any duration, traffic high visibility garments that

    meet the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) requirements for
    

night-time work must be used. Closing a cycling facility and requiring cyclists to dismount should be avoided wherever possible. NOTE Care must be taken to ensure that lighting used to illuminate the work site is not aimed at drivers. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 3 59 SECTION 3 2. All work vehicles present, must have four-way flashers and an amber 360-degree beacon

    (4WF/360°).
    

3.  Where cones are used, they must be 700 mm with one standard white retroreflective

    (minimum Type III, high intensity) 100 to 150 mm wide cone collar mounted onto the
    

upper one-third of the cone taper, 100 mm below the top of the cone. 4. Reflectorized barrels, TC-54, should be considered as an alternative to cones on multi-lane non-freeways, where conditions permit, and must be used on freeways. 5. Where a lane is closed or occupied, or during shoulder work where no work vehicle is in

    place, trailer mounted TC-12 flashing arrow board(s) or TC-7 and flashing amber light must
    

be placed at the end of the taper. 6. For intersection zone painting, 450 mm cones with a white retroreflective (minimum Type

    III, high intensity) cone collar may be used instead of 700 mm cones during the painting
    

operation. After painting is completed, while the paint is drying, a TC-4 may be used as a replacement for the TC-12. 7. Planned SD night-time work should not be conducted in fog or when highways are slippery.

    a) If wet or slippery roads or poor visibility are present when emergency work
    

must be performed, an advance trailer-mounted TC-12 must be used and positioned as soon as possible.

    b) LD taper lengths (Table B) rather than SD taper lengths (Table A) should be
    

considered. 8. Pedestrian barricades should be used where necessary to provide adequate protection and guidance to pedestrians in work zones. 3.8.2 Work Zone Lighting 3.8.2.1 Lighting of Work Area Construction, maintenance, and other activities often create conditions that are particularly hazardous at night when the ability of drivers to see clearly is reduced. The need for illumination by floodlight or steady burning lamps must be thoroughly investigated, and the following must be considered:

1.  The OHSA requires adequate lighting for its intended use.
2.  Care must be taken to ensure that lighting used to illuminate the work site is not aimed at drivers, making it more difficult for them to see their intended path.
3.  Lighting systems used for night-time work must be mounted at least 5.0 metres above the highway, except for dome or balloon style lights with soft wide light that does not produce glare. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 360 SECTION 3
4.  Lighting should be set up so that it is aimed in an arc from 90 degrees to the traffic flow, up to 45 degrees away from the traffic, but under no circumstances should lights be aimed at, or spill over onto, oncoming traffic.
5.  Any additional lighting mounted on construction or maintenance equipment should be directed and focused on the immediate work area and should not be used as general floodlights to illuminate a construction site. +NOTE
6.  Lighting should not interfere with the ability of motorists to navigate their way through the work zone. 3.8.2.2 Highway Lighting through a Work Zone Illumination of the driver’s path through a construction work zone may: • Assist the driver in making timely decisions. • Partially compensate for an undesirable alignment. • Lessen the visual impact of an illuminated work zone on the driver. Night-time construction often requires that lighting of working areas be brighter than the adjacent highway. Although construction illumination is directed away from the driver’s path, some illumination typically spills onto the pavement surface and is reflected into the driver’s field of vision. Illumination of the highway through a work zone can therefore reduce the impact of construction lighting on the driver. 3.8.2.3 Anti-glare Screening Anti-glare screening on freeway construction work zones should be considered to reduce the impact of headlights on the driver where:
7.  A crossover is built on a freeway.
8.  The median width is reduced to 4.0 metres or less.
9.  A curved highway alignment directs headlights into the path of opposing drivers.
10.  Night-time truck volume is greater than 10%.
11.  Night-time traffic volume is Level of Service (LOS) D, or greater. Anti-glare screening should not be used in winter because of the impact on snow drifting. Lighting should not interfere with the ability of motorists to navigate through the work zone. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 61 SECTION 4 4 Temporary Traffic Control Devices Traffic control devices are an important part of a work zone. Section 4 provides general descriptions, applications, specifications, and quality replacement guidelines for typical traffic control devices in temporary work zones, as required for work on highways in Ontario. General guidance is also provided for the application of new technologies. Descriptions of Traffic Control Devices: • Will assist all users in understanding available and appropriate devices. • Will be of interest to users required to either modify an existing typical layout or develop a new typical layout for a unique situation, which may require additional or alternate devices. Application of Traffic Control Devices • Traffic Control Devices are used as required for work on public highways and will be of interest to: ⚪ Designers, contractors, and road authorities in preparing or ordering a schedule of devices, ⚪ Any person who is deploying the devices in reference to typical layouts, and ⚪ Supervisors or enforcement officers in evaluating the compliance of devices on site. Specifications of Traffic Control Devices Specifications are to be used once devices have been identified based on the fundamental and guiding principles described in Sections 1 through 3, and/or through a layout. Specifications for traffic control devices, covered in this section, include: • Devices for channelization guidance and information. • Devices to regulate and control the flow of traffic. • Devices to provide advanced notification, warning, and alternate route. • Positive protection devices. Device specification is particularly relevant to designers, contractors, and road authorities in preparing or ordering a schedule of devices, any person who is deploying the devices in reference to layouts, and supervisors or enforcement officers in evaluating the compliance of devices on-site. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 462 SECTION 4 Quality Replacement of Traffic Control Devices Traffic control devices in work zones are often subjected to wear and damage, which may result in loss of effectiveness due to soiling, deformation, gashes, breakage, and loss of/damage to reflective sheeting, text, or symbols. • Quality of traffic control devices in work zones depends on good visibility and legibility of the traffic control devices being used. +NOTE • Once a construction site has been correctly equipped with all necessary signs, markings, and other devices, they must be maintained in optimum operational condition. 4.1 General Quality Guidelines for Traffic Control Devices All traffic control devices used in work zones must conform to the requirements of OTM Book 7 and contract documents with regard to size, shape, colour, placement, and legend message. Compliance

    to these documents must be maintained for the duration of the project. Section 25 (1)(b) of the OHSA
    

places responsibility on employers to ensure that equipment, materials, and protective devices are maintained in good condition. Device quality should be evaluated at various stages including: • While in storage. • While in preparation for drop off at a work zone. • During installation. • Regularly during the course of the work. Good quality control throughout various stages of the work will reduce costs and minimize the need for replacement on-site. Traffic control devices should be routinely inspected. Signs should be as near vertical as possible. Any situation where there are more than two adjacent channelizing devices missing or substantially out of alignment will cause an unacceptable situation and should be corrected immediately. Traffic control devices should routinely be inspected at night to ensure that the level of retro reflectivity is adequate, and the devices are clearly visible, legible, and placed appropriately. +NOTE Devices must be maintained in optimum operational condition. NOTE Traffic control devices should routinely be inspected at night. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 63 SECTION 4 For the purpose of Book 7, the quality of work zone devices has been divided into three categories, further defined in the Table 4.1 below: • Acceptable devices. • Marginally acceptable devices. • Unacceptable devices. Table 4.1 Quality of Acceptable Work Zone Devices Acceptable Devices Marginally AcceptableDevices Unacceptable Devices • Meet quality, design, size, and colour requirements. • May be used on highway construction, maintenance, utility, and other projects. • Percentage of acceptable devices shall be at least 50% at any time, or as contained in the contract specifications, or road authority requirements. • The 50% acceptability criterion applies to each traffic control device

    type taken by itself. (e.g.,
    

50% of barrels, 50% of TC series signs, 50% of

    delineators etc.)
    

• At or near the lower end of acceptability for quality, design, size, and colour requirements. • May be used until they become unacceptable. • Percentage of marginally acceptable devices should not exceed 50% at any time and, if used, shall be interspersed with acceptable devices so that a sizeable length of a work zone does not have all marginally acceptable devices. • Should not be delivered to the work zone or used on a work project. • Shall be replaced or repaired within 12 hours of notification, or as contained in the contract specifications or road authority requirements. • Where 10% or more of the surface of a traffic control device, or 20% of the retro- reflective material on a traffic control device is damaged or missing, the device is considered unacceptable and shall be removed from service. • For key communication items in a work zone, if the message or symbol on a traffic control device becomes unclear, the device is unacceptable. Since it is not practical to require new devices at all times, some degradation of devices can be

    accommodated without significant loss of effectiveness; however, a standard of quality must be
    

maintained.

    The 50% acceptability criterion applies to each traffic control device type taken by itself. (e.g., 50% of barrels, 50% of TC series
    

    signs, 50% of delineators etc.)
    

NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 464 SECTION 4 4.1.1 Evaluation Guide for Traffic Control Devices The selected traffic control devices illustrated in Figures 4.1 to 4.3, together with the accompanying descriptions, should be used as a guide to determine whether a device is acceptable, marginally acceptable, or unacceptable.

NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 468 SECTION 4 4.2 Devices for Channelization, Guidance, and Information The purpose of using traffic control devices for channelization, guidance, and information in temporary work zones is to: • Alert highway users to hazards created by construction, maintenance, or other activities in or near the travelled way. • Separate traffic from work areas, pavement drop-offs, or storage areas, and to direct highway users safely past hazards. • Channelize highway users from one lane to another, into a detour, diversion, or to a reduced lane width. • Delineate the highway alignment. • Produce the desired behaviour in highway users. Depending on the highway environment, traffic cones, construction markers, or flexible drums are used to channelize highway users and delineate its alignment. Typical devices used for channelization, guidance, and information include:

1.  Traffic Cones.
2.  Construction Markers.
3.  Flexible Drums (Barrels).
4.  Barricades.
5.  Barriers.
6.  Temporary Pavement Markings and Highway Delineation.
7.  Signs. Diagrams of these devices are shown in the following sections and include details regarding: • General purpose and typical applications for each device. • Specifications as required for work on public highways. • Evaluation guide for a selection of traffic control devices to determine whether they are:

    acceptable, marginally acceptable, or unacceptable devices (See Section 4).
    

BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 69 SECTION 4 4.2.1 Traffic Cones Specifications Purpose

    Traffic Cones (TC-51) are used to:
    

• Delineate diversions and closed lanes. • Mark channelizing tapers in advance of closed or narrowed lanes. • Delineate highway alignment, and guide traffic through the work area. • Alert highway users to hazards or separate traffic from the work area.

    Traffic cones are primarily used for Very short or Short Duration (SD) operations on non-freeways.
    

Conditions • The required spacing of traffic cones is provided in the appropriate table

    (Table A, Table B, and Table C: ‘D’).
    

• All traffic cones must have a reflective white collar, 100 mm to +NOTE 150 mm wide, mounted on the upper one-third of the cone taper,

    100 mm below the top of the cone or marker (Type III or IV, high
    

    intensity reflective sheeting).
    

• Consideration should be given to other channelizing devices for high speed, high volume areas. Reflectorized TC-52 or TC-54 may be used, and in some cases, must be used as alternatives to cones. • Cones affected by high winds should be used with ballast. The ballast must not present a hazard if the cone is struck. Suggested means of ballasting include: ⚪ Doubling the cones, or the use of heavier weighted cones. ⚪ Special weighted bases, or masses such as sandbag rings or ballast rings made of recycled tires. 450 mm TC-51A 700 mm TC-51B 1000 mm TC-51C All traffic cones must have a reflective white collar.

4.2.4 Barricades Purpose

    Traffic Barricades (TC-53) are devices, typically with one or two rails, which provide a visual indicator
    

of a hazardous location, or the desired path that a highway user should take but are not intended to contain or redirect a vehicle. The primary function of a traffic barricade is to: • Block off a portion, or all of a highway to discourage vehicular traffic from penetrating into work area. • Delineate highway excavation sites or other work site hazards. Barricades may be used for SD highway closures. Barricades are only supplemental to other delineation devices and are not to be used as the primary delineation around an excavation or obstacle. Approaches to barricades should be adequately marked. A general description of barricades for pedestrian safety is provided in Section 3.7. Specifications Conditions • The use of TC-53A or TC-53B depends on the approach speed of +NOTE traffic and the nature and severity of hazards for which these devices provide awareness. • The TC-53A or TC-53B must not be used as a channelizing device. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 73 SECTION 4 Size • One or two horizontal cross bars 200 mm x variable length, top edge mounted 1000 mm above ground level.

    4.2.5 Temporary Construction Barrier System (TCBS)
    

Purpose A temporary construction barrier system, such as a Temporary Concrete Barrier, is a device which provides a physical limitation through which a vehicle would not normally pass and is intended to contain or redirect an errant vehicle of a particular size range at a given speed and angle of impact. Barriers are primarily used as positive protection devices. Their use should be determined by the protection requirements of the location and should not be considered channelizing devices. For general guidelines on the application of barriers as positive protection devices and when they are required, see Section 4.5.3. Barriers for worker and person safety, in and around the work site, including excavations where worker or person exposed to fall of 2.4 m are covered by

    O.Reg. 213/91, Sections 26.3 and 233(4) under the OSHA. +NOTE
    

Temporary barriers used in Ontario must, at minimum, meet the requirements of MASH TL-3, Ontario

    Provincial Standard Specifications (OPSS), and be placed in accordance with the Ontario Roadside
    

Design Manual. Table E Usage of Channelizing Devices, Barricades, and Barriers in Section 6 provides general guidelines for the use of cones, markers, barricades, and barriers. 4.2.6 Temporary Pavement Markings, and Highway Delineation 4.2.6.1 Temporary Pavement Markings Purpose Temporary pavement markings are used to mark the intended vehicle path that traffic is to follow, normally in combination with: • Appropriate signs. • Channelizing devices. • Delineation. The use of barriers should be determined by the protection requirements of the location and should not be considered channelizing devices. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 474 SECTION 4 Where possible, highway users within a work zone should be provided with pavement markings comparable to the markings normally maintained along adjacent highways. Temporary pavement markings must be maintained:

    • In Long Duration (LD) stationary work zones on non-freeways.
    

• In both LD and SD work zones on freeways where traffic is diverted from its normal path. • Where guidance by appropriate signs, channelizing devices, or delineation does not clearly and adequately indicate the required vehicle path. Temporary pavement markings should also be considered on projects with partial pavement removal

    (milling) and markings should, as closely as possible, reflect the pavement markings which have been
    

removed. Temporary No Passing zones should be marked within a construction zone, where lane changing is discouraged. General Specifications General specifications for temporary pavement markings are detailed below: • Details on colour, pattern, and retro-reflectivity of pavement markings

    are provided in OTM Book 11 (Pavement, Hazard and Delineation
    

    Markings). +NOTE
    

• Temporary pavement markings must comply with the standards prescribed in OTM Books 7 and 11. • Any deviations from the standard are subject to approval by the road authority. • Temporary pavement markings must align with the existing markings at both ends of a work zone. • Markings shall be placed on hard-surfaced detours or temporary alignments before they are opened to traffic. • Directional dividing lines shall be placed, replaced, or delineated where appropriate before the highway is opened to traffic. Colour Pavement markings are generally white or yellow unless otherwise stated. Where there is little colour contrast between the pavement and the white pavement markings, the contrast may be improved by: Deviations from the standard for pavement markings in OTM Books 7 and 11 are subject to approval from the road authority. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 75 SECTION 4 Orange pavement markings should only be used for temporary alignment changes on divided multi- lane highways. NOTE• Using black in the gaps of a broken pavement line. +NOTE • Using marking tape with white stripes bordered by black on both sides. • Applying white paint over a double-application black painted line. • Using orange temporary pavement markings. Orange pavement markings should only be used for temporary alignment changes on divided multi-lane highways and are described further in Section 4.2.6.2. Temporary Raised Pavement Markers Where temporary markings are placed in accordance with the principles of colour and pattern described in OTM Book 11, temporary raised pavement markers may be used as an enhancement. These markers provide: • Enhanced retro-reflectivity at night. • Enhanced delineation through alignment changes. • Reinforced travel path through areas where there may be confusion resulting from removal of existing markings which can cause scarring and/or phantom marks under

    certain lighting conditions (e.g., low sun angle from sunrise or sunset)
    

Removal of Existing Markings Pavement markings that are no longer applicable or do not define the safe path of travel must be removed, as soon as practical, to prevent motorist confusion.

    Markings are commonly removed by blasting (soda, water) or grinding.
    

Removal should minimize damage to the highway surface or texture. Thermoplastics and permanent tapes are generally more difficult than paints to remove effectively. Temporary tapes are fabricated to be easily removed by hand and are the preferred solution. Although painting over invalid markings with black paint or bituminous solutions can be a satisfactory solution for the short-term, this method is not a preferred removal technique for the following reasons. • The covering material wears, so that the invalid markings eventually reappear. • Markings covered in this way remain visible under some low-light conditions. Short Term Pavement Markings Short term pavement marking is required when a paved highway is to be opened to the general public prior to the application of permanent markings. Permanent pavement markings must be installed on freeways of six or more lanes before opening to traffic. On other highways, if permanent TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 476 SECTION 4 pavement markings cannot be installed immediately, interim temporary pavement markings must be installed, followed by permanent markings within the time frames and for the highway types noted

    below:
    

• Four-lane freeways – within 15 working days. • Multi-lane non-freeways – within 15 working days. • Two-lane highways – within 20 working days.

    In these situations, short term pavement markings should be 0.3 metre (length) markings with
    

15 metre gaps. If No Passing zones cannot be marked during the interim period, they must be

    established by using signs (Rb-31 DO NOT PASS and Rb-35 PASSING PERMITTED).
    

4.2.6.2 Orange Temporary Pavement Markings Purpose Orange temporary pavement markings should primarily be used on divided multi-lane highways with a normal posted speed of 90 km/h or higher, where there are changes in alignment to accommodate construction staging and there is the need to: • Reduce driver confusion resulting from removal of existing markings on asphalt, which can cause scarring and/or phantom marks under certain

    lighting conditions (e.g., low sun angle from sunrise or sunset). +NOTE
    

    • Improve the contrast on concrete (i.e., the contrast between orange
    

markings and light-coloured concrete is much better than that between

    white markings and concrete).
    

• Enhance daytime and night-time visibility. • Provide an additional visual cue to indicate that the highway user is within a construction zone. On provincial highways, orange pavement markings are only to be used when recommended by regional Traffic. Specifications When orange temporary pavement markings are used: • The markings should be applied at the start of the transition, leading up to the new alignment, and continue through the entire length of the construction zone up to where traffic returns to the original alignment. On provincial highways, orange pavement markings are only to be used when recommended by Regional Traffic. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 77 SECTION 4 The type of material used as orange temporary pavement markings must consider the pavement surface, ambient temperature at the time of application, annual average daily traffic, and expected service life duration. NOTE • All longitudinal lines within a construction zone, including left edge, skip, right edge,

    interchange, and High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane markings, shall be orange in colour
    

and markings shall be applied to highway surfaces and not over existing pavement markings. • All existing pavement markings within a construction zone shall be removed according to road authority specifications. • Fluorescent orange markings can also be used at the discretion of the road authority when there are operational concerns as a result of multiple sets of pavement markings. This may include areas where the speeds are less than 90 km/h or areas where operational problems may be confusing to the driver. • They shall be applied in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations and within the temperature limits recommended by the material manufacturer. Other considerations for the use of orange temporary pavement markings include: +NOTE • Using during winter shut down operations if existing construction staging and temporary construction signing remain in effect over the winter months. • The type of material being used as orange temporary pavement markings must consider: ⚪ Pavement surface. ⚪ Ambient temperature at the time of application. ⚪ Annual average daily traffic. ⚪ Expected service life duration.

    • The length of the stage(s) and if orange temporary pavement
    

markings are to be placed on asphalt that will not be resurfaced upon the completion of construction. • The actual service life of any marking material will vary, depending on turning movements, traffic volume, and level/type of winter maintenance activities at the specific site. 4.2.6.3 Highway Delineators Purpose Delineation of the highway during daytime can be effectively accomplished with pavement markings. However, night-time visibility often requires the use of delineators to provide long-range demarcation of the highway alignment. Furthermore, delineators remain visible under adverse weather conditions. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 478 SECTION 4 Delineators are small retro-reflective devices that: • Are erected in series to guide drivers and are typically mounted on posts or barriers or in the highway. • Define the horizontal alignment of the highway and help the driver to identify its limits. • Are guidance devices and are generally not intended as warning +NOTE devices. They are placed in or on the highway:

    • Adjacent to the shoulder (in rural areas).
    

    • On the edge of the travelled portion of the highway (in urban areas).
    

• On the top or side of the median or temporary barriers. More than one type of device can be used to delineate the highway, but the application should be consistent throughout the work zone. Types of delineation include:

    • Temporary raised pavement markers (TRPM).
    

    • Painted curb markings (islands).
    

• Small reflective post-mounted delineators. • Barrier-mounted delineators. • TC-18 CHEVRON ALIGNMENT sign. Delineation of the highway can also be provided with: • Cones. • Construction markers.

    • Flexible barrels (drums).
    

    Delineation is more fully addressed in OTM Book 11 (Pavement, Hazard and Delineation Markings).
    

Specifications The following specifications apply to delineators: • All in-service delineators must, as a minimum, employ materials that conform to ASTM D4956-19a or its subsequent revisions for Type III

    (high intensity) and Type IV (prismatic) materials.
    

More than one type of device can be used to delineate the highway, but the application should be consistent throughout the work zone. NOTE Delineator conditions must be regularly inspected, and maintenance or replacement of damaged delineators should be implemented as soon as practical. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 79 SECTION 4 • Off-roadway delineators should be installed so they are within the driver’s cone of vision and positioned: ⚪ 1.25 metres to 4.0 metres from the edge of the roadway. +NOTE ⚪ 0.6 metres to 2.4 metres beyond the outside edge of a shoulder. ⚪ In line with a highway barrier that is 2.4 metres or less beyond the outer edge of a shoulder. • Delineators should be placed at a constant distance from the edge of the roadway. • Post-mounted delineators or barrier-mounted delineators should be placed on or as close as possible to a temporary barrier, at spacings from 20 metres to 40 metres. • Delineator conditions must be regularly inspected. Maintenance or replacement of damaged delineators should be implemented as soon as practical. 4.2.7 Signs There are three classifications of signs used in temporary conditions: regulatory, warning, and guide. Warning and guide signs include both passive as well as dynamic signs that allow for illuminated and/or changeable messaging. +NOTE Signs are placed in positions where they will most effectively convey the message without restricting lateral clearance or sight distance, and at advance distances that will allow a sufficient response time.

1.  Regulatory Signs Regulatory signs impose legal obligations and/or restrictions on all traffic. While temporary traffic control is most commonly accomplished through warning signs, there are situations where the use of regulatory signs becomes necessary. These situations can include closures of highways, turn restrictions and enforcement of speed reductions.

    Regulatory signs must conform to OTM Book 5 (Regulatory Signs).
    

2.  Warning Signs Warning signs for temporary conditions are the most important signs used to advise highway users of specific hazards that may be encountered. Warning signs for construction and maintenance or other work within a highway are typically: • Diamond-shaped with an orange reflectorized background and a black symbol and/or legend message and a black sign border. There are three classifications of signs that are used in temporary

    conditions:
    

regulatory, warning, and guide. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 480 SECTION 4 • Standard black on yellow where warning signs refer to permanent conditions that exist

    before, during, and after construction (e.g., steep hill, merge).
    

3.  Guide Signs Guide signs are required to guide traffic around or through work areas or provide information to highway users related to detours, directions and types of construction. Guide signs, with few exceptions, have a rectangular shape with the longer dimension being horizontal. However, in some locations, because of lateral space limitations, the longer dimension may be vertical. Temporary conditions guide signs typically have either: • A white reflectorized background with a black legend and a sign border. Part of the sign legend may be black on orange to tell the driver about the specific condition related to the work zone. • An orange reflectorized background with a black legend and sign border. Guide signs that indicate highway names and directions generally have a reflectorized green or blue background with a white legend and border, or a white background with a black legend. To show changes due to construction black legends or symbols on an orange reflectorized background may be used as an overlay on existing directional guide signs. Where conspicuity of the ground mounted guide signs compared to other temporary conditions

    (black/orange signs) is an issue, the road authority may require standard guide signs to be used.
    

Sign Designation for Temporary Conditions Most of the signs in OTM Book 7 are designated by the letters “TC” followed by a number. The letters “TC” indicates the “Temporary Conditions” series of signs. Regulatory signs used in temporary conditions have been given “Rb” numbers.

    Sign pattern files are provided on the CD contained in OTM Book 2 (Sign Design, Fabrication &
    

    Patterns).
    

Roll-up signs may be used however, they are not recommended for use on freeways and they must conform to the sign specifications outlined in the OTM Book 7 and OTM Book 2. Roll-up signs must meet the ASTM Type VI specification and must conform to the retro-reflectivity level specified in Table 4.3 Minimum Retro-Reflectivity Requirements. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 81 SECTION 4 4.2.8 Traffic Control Sign Specifications This section provides detailed descriptions of the purpose and proper use of each sign typically used in temporary traffic control. General guidelines for size, retro-reflectivity, material, and installation are provided below. Where specifications are prescribed in the descriptions for

    individual signs (in Section 4.2.8.5 or Layouts), they must be used. +NOTE
    

Dimensions, including supports, positioning, and pertinent installation details for

    all signs, including all temporary condition signs are shown in OTM Book 1b (Sign Design Principles),
    

    OTM Book 2 (Sign Design, Fabrication & Patterns) and OTM Book 3 (Sign Support and Installation).
    

Full scale patterns for the signs indicated herein are available in the OTM Book 2 CD. All French translations must be approved by the road authority. 4.2.8.1 Sign Size The Standard sign sizes shown in OTM Book 7 are recommended for typical work zones in two-lane

    and multi-lane (up to 4 lanes) highways with Normal Posted Regulatory Speed (NPRS) of 80 km/h or
    

lower.

    Oversized sign sizes are preferred on multi-lane (more than 4 lanes) highways with a Normal Posted
    

    Regulatory Speed (NPRS) greater than 60 km/h but less than 90 km/h, and are required on highways
    

with NPRS of 90 km/h or higher.

    Where dimensions are not prescribed in the descriptions for individual signs (in Section 4.2.8.5 or
    

    Layouts), Table 4.2 Minimum Dimensions of Work Zone Warning Signs provides a general guideline
    

of sign sizes to be used for a range of work zone situations. Table 4.2 Minimum Dimensions of Work Zone Warning Signs

   If space does not permit an oversized sign, signing is to be repeated on the right side. \\ On divided highways, signing is to be repeated on the left if there are more than two lanes in one direction. Supplementary signs may be located on the left side of the highway where the median is wide enough to safely accommodate the signs or repeated on the right side if the median is too narrow. 4.2.8.2 Sign Retro-Reflectivity Standards

    Regulatory, warning, and guidance (directional) signs need to be legible and conspicuous at night as
    

well as during the day. General standards include: • The colour of the sign must appear to be the same at night as by day. • The retro-reflectivity of a sign is important for maintaining a satisfactory level of sign legibility and conspicuity at night. • Retro-reflectivity requirements stated in Book 7 are the minimums. • Standard levels for reflectivity are identified as Type I through Type XI and are defined in detail in ASTM D4956-19, or its subsequent revisions, and in OTM Book 2. Signs that are the most important to ensure highway user and worker safety must have the highest levels of reflectivity. Temporary Conditions signs are grouped into two levels of importance with a corresponding minimum background reflectivity: • Lowest level signs must have a minimum background reflectivity of Type III

    (high-intensity).
    

• Highest level signs must have a minimum background reflectivity of Type VII

    (high reflectivity micro-prismatic fluorescent).
    

    Except for TC-12, higher reflectivity may be used where the road authority considers it necessary;
    

Oversized signs are required on highways with a NPRS of 90 km/h or higher. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 83 SECTION 4 however, the relative importance of the signs in the two-level hierarchy should not be lost in doing so. As of January 1, 2022, newly installed temporary conditions signs must meet the minimum reflectivity levels stated in OTM Book 7. As of January 1, 2026 all temporary conditions signs must meet the

    minimum reflectivity levels stated in OTM Book 7. Please refer to OTM Book 5 (Regulatory Signs) and
    

    OTM Book 6 (Warning Signs) for minimum reflectivity requirements. The sheeting levels indicated
    

    above for fabricating OTM Book 7 signs must conform to the ASTM (American Society for Testing and
    

    Material) Standard Specification D4956-19 or its subsequent versions.
    

The minimum reflectivity requirements for various signs are shown below in Table 4.3 Minimum Retro-Reflectivity Requirements. Table 4.3 Minimum Retro-Reflectivity Requirements Minimum Retro-Reflectivity Signs/Devices Importance Hierarchy Type VII or greater

4.2.8.3 Sign Material and Thickness Typical materials and thicknesses for signs are: • Aluminum with a thickness of 2.0 mm. • Galvanized steel with a thickness of 1.6 mm. • Plywood with thicknesses of: ⚪ 19 mm - standard for use on provincial highways. ⚪ 12.5 mm - may be used for sign sizes of 1200 mm x 1200 mm, or smaller. Signs larger than 900 mm x 900 mm should be made of plywood rather than aluminum or steel. Plywood may also be used for smaller signs. +NOTE Other materials for signs are: • Fibreglass. • Reinforced plastic or other material. The use of plastic or other material as sign blank material is subject to approval by the road authority. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 484 SECTION 4 These materials may be substituted for some aluminum or galvanized steel sign blanks. The use of plastic or other material as sign blank material is subject to approval by the road authority. Roll up signs are often made of flexible material to allow ease of transportation while still meeting minimum reflectivity requirements in Section 4.2.8.5.

    Comprehensive coverage of sign installation is found in OTM Book 3 (Ground Mounted Sign Support
    

    and Installation).
    

Specifications for sign installation in work zones follows: • Signs should be located where drivers expect to see them, typically on the right side of the highway and must be in a position where they can be readily seen by highway users at all times. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 85 SECTION 4

    • Supplementary (i.e., repeated signs) should also be used on freeways or on multi-lane
    

highways where experience has shown that drivers fail to see the primary signs. See Table 4.2 Minimum Dimensions of Work Zone Warning Signs. • Supplementary signs may be located on the left side of the highway where the median is wide enough to safely accommodate the signs or repeated on the right side if the median is too narrow. • Signs must be placed in positions where they will most effectively convey the required message without restricting lateral clearance or sight distance, and at advance distances that allow sufficient response time. Typical sign placement is shown below in Figure 4.4 Typical Sign Placement. Figure 4.4 Typical Sign Placement Ground Mounted Portable Stands ONE WAY ROADWAY The objective is to place the signs in the driver’s cone of vision.

The location and maintenance of all regulatory signs need to be given high priority. STOP/YIELD signs must always be maintained and be visible. They must be properly located and relocated as necessary through the various stages of construction or maintenance to ensure that the desired, intended right-of-way control is always in effect. • All temporary signs must be removed or covered immediately after they are no longer applicable. • Permanent signs must be in place at the completion of each work project.

    • Signs that pertain to a moving operation (e.g., hot mix paving) must be
    

shifted along the highway as the operation proceeds. +NOTE • Signs must be mounted at almost right angles to the direction of travel they are to serve, angled three to five degrees away from the highway. Adjustments to the height and distance requirements may have to be made to allow placement of signs in constricted urban areas. • Sign supports placed in the clear zone adjacent to a highway must yield or break away upon impact to minimize hazards to motorists and not present an undue hazard to

    workers. Signs must not be mounted in, or on, weighted barrels (e.g., 45-gallon steel
    

    drums).
    

• Signs for construction projects on both freeways and non-freeways must either be installed on direct buried posts or mounted on bases with sufficient ballast that they will remain in position for the duration of the project. ⚪ Permanent type supports are preferable for long-term projects as well as for STOP and YIELD signs. ⚪ Sign supports or bases should be designed to be safe when impacted. ⚪ The ballast must not comprise a material and/or size, such as a piece of steel or block of concrete, that could be hazardous if struck by a vehicle. Ground-Mounted Signs Specifications for Small Temporary Ground Mounted Signs are as follows: • Signs that are 1200 mm or less in width must be installed on single or double posts with the bottom edge of the sign at a height of 1.5 metres to 2.5 metres above the travelled portion of a highway. • Signs that exceed 1200 mm in width must be installed on two posts at a general height of 1.5 metres above the travelled portion of a highway to the bottom edge of the sign, with the exception of the diamond-shaped two-post sign which shall have a minimum height of 1.0 metre. All temporary signs must be removed or covered immediately after they are no longer applicable. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 87 SECTION 4 Low-mounted portable sign stands

    (e.g. A-frame type)
    

may only be used for TC-2A or TC-21. NOTE • The lateral distance from the edge of a highway to the nearer edge of the sign must be

    from 2.0 metres to 4.0 metres on freeways (rural and urban) and highways in rural areas,
    

and 0.3 metres to 2.0 metres on non-freeways in urban areas. Portable Stands Specifications for Portable Stands are as follows: • Installed signs are usually positioned on the usable portion of a shoulder. The portable supports for these signs should be constructed in such a manner that they will not be a hazard to errant vehicles, yet sufficient to remain upright. +NOTE • Signs that are less than 900 mm in width must be installed at a height of 1.5 metres to 2.5 metres above a highway. • Signs that are 900 mm or greater in width must be installed at a height of 1.0 metres to 2.5 metres above a highway.

    • Low-mounted portable sign stands (e.g., A-frame type) may only
    

    be used for TC-2A ROAD WORK (short duration) or TC-21 TRAFFIC
    

CONTROL PERSON AHEAD signs. ⚪ Signs mounted on these stands must have flags attached to them to bring the attention of drivers to the message on the sign. ⚪ The bottom of the flags should be approximately 1.5 metres to 2.5 metres from the ground.

    ⚪ The sign bases must be made of a sound material to adequately support the sign;
    

however, the base should not be appreciably wider than the sign. ⚪ Ballast, if required, will help to prevent the sign from blowing over by the wind. The ballast must not comprise a material and/or size, such as a piece of steel or block of concrete, that could be hazardous if struck by a vehicle.

    • Roll-up signs may be used; however, the specifications must conform to the sign
    

    specifications outlined in OTM Book 7 and OTM Book 2 (Sign Design, Fabrication,
    

    and Patterns) and they must be able to withstand the push/pull from vehicles in the
    

    environment they are to be used in (i.e., freeway, non-freeway, high volume of heavy
    

    vehicles).
    

• Signs may require ballast. Ballast is recommended to be made of water-resistant bags filled with small stone weighing no more than 12 kg for ergonomic considerations. For intermediate or large sign supports refer to OTM Book 3.

Purpose

    The TC-31L TRUCK ENTRANCE, TC-31A TRUCK ENTRANCE (WITH AMBER FLASHERS), and TC-20At
    

When Flashing tab signs must be used to warn of trucks entering highway. Conditions

    • Must be used when trucks are using an entrance from a work zone into a live lane (turn or
    

    crossing movement).
    

• Must be installed in advance of the crossing at the distance specified in the appropriate

    table (Table A, Table B, or Table C: ‘F’).
    

• The truck entrance sign illustrates the truck entering the highway, not the work area. • If the truck entrance is on the left, the TC-31L sign must be used. The TC-31R sign must be used when the truck entrance is on the right. • Where the presence of a truck that is about to enter the highway is automatically detected, the TC-31A sign is used with two amber flashers, one on each side of the sign, alternating in a side-to-side manner, activated by the detector, so that the amber flashers provide a real time signal to motorists that a truck is about to enter the highway. ⚪ When the TC-31A sign is used, the TC-20At tab sign must also be used.

    ⚪ The flashers should not be continuously flashing; otherwise, they will lose their
    

effectiveness. ⚪ Care must be taken to ensure that the detector system that is activating the flashers is intact and properly functioning. • May also be used where the temporary condition limits the vision of an existing crossing

    that is heavily used by trucks (see OTM Book 6 (Warning Signs) for sight distance criteria).

General Guidelines: • Messages must not: ⚪ Exceed three lines of message, except during advance notification phase.

    ⚪ Exceed six (6) major elements of information on one sign (i.e., one key word, a
    

    number, or a symbol).
    

    ⚪ Use modifiers to highway names (i.e., Highway, Road, Street, Avenue, etc.).
    

• Where space for signs is limited or concerns exist regarding an overload of information presented to the driver: ⚪ Information on navigational restrictions must take precedence over information on capacity restrictions. ⚪ Temporary conditions traffic management signing takes precedence over contract identification and contractor advertising signing. • Messages regarding limits of a closure identify first and last points of access that are closed. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4142 SECTION 4 • Cardinal direction information is preferred for the purpose of orientation, except where such information may prove confusing. In such instances, destination-type information

    (e.g., QEW Toronto) may be substituted.
    

• Permanent signing must be amended to agree with temporary signing. • For full detail of message guidelines, refer to Section 3.3 of the TCTM Manual. Specific Guidelines:

1.  Advance Notification Signing (ANS) Sign Location Line 1 Line 2 Line 3 Line 4 • Affected Route. • Crossing highways. • Upstream Crossing highways. • Where the event will occur. • What the future operational impacts on traffic will be. • What is the extent of the activity? • When is it scheduled to start?

    Example:
    

2.  Advance Warning Signing (AWS) Sign Location Line 1 Line 2 Line 3 • Affected Route. • Crossing highways. • Upstream crossing highways. • Where the event will occur. • What are the current operational impacts on traffic? • What is the extent of the activity? Collectors EAST Here–There To Be Closed Starts May 31 BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 143 SECTION 4

    Example:
    

3.  Alternative Route Signing (ARS) Two levels of alternative route information can be provided. Sign Location Line 1 Line 2 Line 3 • Affected Route. • Crossing highways. • What routes are affected? • “Via”, indicating what follows is the alternative route to reach the affected links. • The alternative route.

    Example: Followed by a second sign:

    3a). Intercept Alternative Route Signing (IARS) and Intercept Detour Route Signing (IDRS)
    

Both IARS and IDRS are two-sign systems. Sign Location Line 1 Line 2 Line 3 • Parallel highway. • Upstream crossing highway. • What routes are affected? • “Via”, indicating what follows is the alternative route to reach the affected links. • The alternative route.

    Example:
    

    3b). Detour Route Signing (DRS)
    

DRS is a further enhancement to the basic ARS concept. DRS requires the installation of a second sign on the affected route, and trailblazing on the alternative route. Sign Location Line 1 Line 2 Line 3 • Affected Route. • Crossing highway. • What routes are affected? • “Via”, indicating what follows is the alternative route to reach the affected links. • Which trailblazer route to follow

    (i.e., D-1)?
    

    Example:
    

On the second sign, a detour trapezoid symbol would be included in the last line of the message. Detour Trailblazer Signing, described below, would then be placed at each subsequent decision points along the route. Followed by a second sign: Followed by a second sign: 401 Collectors EAST Yonge–Bayview Closed Tonight 10 PM Closed Tonight 10 PM 401 Collectors EAST Yonge–Bayview Via 401 Collectors EAST Avenue Road Via 401 Collectors EAST York Mills/Leslie BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 145 SECTION 4

    3c). Detour Trailblazer Signing (DTS)
    

    DTS takes the detour trapezoid and detour number and pairs it up with either a directional arrow (left,
    

    right, or straight ahead) or with the word “Ends” to communicate directions to drivers at decision
    

points along the route. This provides a route guidance tool to trailblaze the alternative route. 4.2.10.4 Site Selection and Installation of TC-64 The location of TC-64 must ensure adequate visibility, roadside safety, and consideration to the availability of power and communication to install PVMS. Visibility • Horizontal and vertical geometries of a highway will have the greatest effect on the visibility of a sign. Whenever possible, the sign should be placed on a tangent section of the highway, while maintaining the intent of the message content. • On freeways, message signs should be located 1000 metres to 1500 metres upstream of interchange decision points. • On arterial highways, message signs should be located 600 metres to 1000 metres upstream of decision points. • If multiple TC-64 are located close together, but show only one language, a minimum longitudinal distance of 150 metres should separate the signs to allow drivers to read and process the first sign before they see the second one. • TC-64 should not obstruct and should not be obstructed by, any existing signs or other objects. • TC-64 need to be sufficiently away from nearby ground-mounted static signs so that motorists can focus their attention on the message without being distracted by other signs. • When placing a sign within the limits of a construction zone, ensure that it does not interfere with construction operations. 4.2.11 Dynamic Message Signs and Devices Advances in technology have and will continue to increase the use of dynamic signs and devices to provide guidance and information to highway users or enhance static signs in temporary conditions. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4146 SECTION 4 The following sub-sections describe the requirements and specifications for:

    • Portable Variable Message Signs (PVMS).
    

• Physical Specifications for PVMS. • Message Guidelines for PVMS. • Site Selection and Installation of PVMS.

    • Flashing Arrow Board Signs (TC-12).
    

• Speed Display Signs. • Supplementary Flashing Lights.

    4.2.11.1 Portable Variable Message Sign (PVMS)
    

PVMS

    PORTABLE VARIABLE MESSAGE SIGN (PVMS)
    

Purpose

    The PORTABLE VARIABLE MESSAGE SIGN (PVMS) should be used in situations where conditions are
    

changing. PVMS are always applied in addition to the required signage as described in Book 7 and should never replace any of the required signs. PVMS should not be use if standard traffic control devices adequately provide information that a highway user needs to travel safely. PVMS are dynamic traffic control devices capable of digitally displaying a variety of messages via elements on the face of the sign that can be activated to form letters or symbols. Messages are limited

    by the size of the sign (usually three lines with eight characters per line). They provide guidance and
    

information to road users and can enhance static signs in temporary conditions. Multifunctional PVMS can fulfill a variety of functions, such as: • Pre-programmed messages. • Radar speed measurement and display. These functions should only be used for those applications where they fully meet the requirements provided in OTM Book 7. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 147 SECTION 4 General aspects of PVMS follow: • A PVMS is housed on a trailer or truck bed and can be quickly deployed to meet the temporary requirements frequently found in work zones or incident areas. • The most common use of PVMS in work zones is for LD construction work. They are typically used to provide highway users with advance notification of work operations which are outside their expectations, such as closures or speed reductions. • In order to achieve a high level of respect for PVMS, message displays must provide highway users with a concise and accurate message relevant to the situation they will be encountering, thus enhancing system credibility and therefore effectiveness. • PVMS should only be used in situations where conditions are changing. PVMS are always applied in addition to the required signage as described in Book 7 and should never replace any of the required signs. If standard traffic control devices adequately provide information that a road user needs to travel safely, PVMS should not be used.

    On provincial highways a PVMS may be used during the following conditions (with duration not
    

    exceeding 9 days):
    

    • Advanced notification of continually changing highway situation (hour
    

    by hour).
    

• Advance notification of closures due to construction or maintenance. • Advance notification of major special events impacting traffic • Notification of short-term lane closures and detours during construction, maintenance, and special events. • Notification of long-term changes in road configuration. • Temporary notification of long-term conditions until static signs can be manufactured. The determination of whether and where PVMS are to be used in a work zone is at the discretion of the road authority. Technical descriptions and specifications for PVMS signs are provided in OTM Book 10

    (Dynamic Message Signs) and PVMS Best Practices Manual (developed by MTO, May 2009).
    

4.2.11.2 Physical Specifications for PVMS A brief description of the physical aspects that must be considered when PVMS are to be used on provincial highways is provided below. PVMS are applied in addition to the required signage as described in this. NOTE The determination of whether and where PVMS are to be used is at the discretion of the road authority. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4148 SECTION 4 Display Elements Display elements must conform to specifications, as they will influence the overall legibility of the sign. Physical aspects include the following: • Signs shall have a 30-pixel high by 56-pixel wide full matrix amber display. • The colour of all pixels should be uniform across the display. • Each PVMS pixel should be capable of achieving a luminance of 40 candelas at the brightest level. • The PVMS should incorporate a photocell control system to automatically adjust the

    brightness as a function of the ambient light level (brighter during the day, dimmer at
    

    night).
    

• The luminance of a PVMS pixel should not decrease by more than 50% when viewed at a minimum angle of 15 degrees centered about the optical axis and perpendicular to the

    surface of the display (half angle of 7.5 degrees).
    

• The sheeting which covers the display elements also influences the legibility of the sign. The sheeting material should minimize glare and reflection in all lighting conditions. • Contrast ratios, technology details, line and character spacing, and fonts should be

    designed as outlined in OTM Book 10 (Dynamic Message Signs).
    

Sign Case The sign case is the structure that protects the display elements and associated electronics from the elements. The MTO PVMS specifications for sign cases found in OTM Book 10 provide further information on the

    following:
    

• Physical requirements of the sign case. • Specifications for the retroreflective border to go around the front outside edge of the sign case to improve the target value of the sign. Solar Panels Solar panels should be supplied with each sign by default. They should be able to tilt and rotate so they can be aimed towards the sun. If signs are deployed in areas where they can be hardwired with power, the solar panels can be removed to prevent theft and vandalism. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 149 SECTION 4 Electrical System The electrical system provided with a PVMS shall be able to operate with batteries recharged by solar panels or a trickle charger, or by using a hardwired power supply.

    Global Positioning System (GPS)
    

A GPS unit integrated with the PVMS controller allows for continuous updating of the PVMS location at any given time. Since PVMS can be used anywhere in any given region, it is important to be able to track them. Misplacement of a single sign due to misunderstanding of its true location can cause: • Operational issues. • Display of incorrect information. The worst effect of this confusion would be to have messages sent to the wrong signs due to misunderstanding of their true location. A GPS unit that is integrated with the sign controller allows for continuous updating of the PVMS location. Sign Face Compass A sign face compass provides the ability to monitor and record the direction of the PVMS, and is an integral part of the PVMS for the following reasons: • Although there is a braking mechanism to prevent the sign face from rotating on its own, due to the large surface area, high winds may cause the sign face to rotate and in extreme cases, could cause the entire PVMS to shift. • Where poor legibility of a PVMS is reported, the operator can check, through the software, on the current direction of the sign face thereby confirming whether poor legibility is due to a rotated sign face. • The compass supports in determining sign location. Since the GPS will generally not provide an accurate enough location to determine which side of the highway a sign is on for two-lane highways, the compass will show the direction of travel that the sign is facing to allow confirmation of the side of the highway that it is on. • Compass functionality may be included as part of the GPS by some manufacturers. Communication Protocol and Control To ensure all PVMS signs available to a given control centre can communicate from the same central software, it is necessary to use a standard communications protocol. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4150 SECTION 4

    • The National Transportation Communications for ITS Protocol (NTCIP), developed in the
    

    USA through several standards agencies (AASHTO, NEMA, etc.), provides an appropriate
    

level of standardization for communication protocols for PVMS and is required for all new PVMS in the Province of Ontario. • The Regional COMPASS Traffic Operations Centre or Communications Centre controls all PVMS messages on provincial highways, whether a contractor or MTO-owned sign, or a third-party rental sign. • Control can range from full messaging responsibility to only the ability to blank or override a sign message when necessary. To enable this communication, it is imperative that supplied signs comply to MTO communication standards. 4.2.11.3 Message Guidelines for PVMS PVMS must provide road users with a concise message relevant to the situation they will be encountering. PVMS used on construction projects and maintenance activities should be treated as an integral part of the Traffic Control Plan and the following information should be listed for all known or anticipated PVMS during a project: • Desired messages. • Locations. • General time periods of display. • The ITS Program sections and regional Traffic must approve all PVMS messages used on signs located on provincial highways. Pre-approved messages should be stored either:

    a) Locally in the PVMS; or,
    

    b) Centrally in the server that runs the PVMS application as per
    

Regional requirements. This prevents spelling errors, missed words, or incoherent/ineffective messages being displayed. When not in use, the PVMS should be turned parallel to the flow of traffic so that

    motorists do not see its screen (if possible).
    

Message Format The format of the PVMS message is important. Road users must receive information in a manner consistent across the province to help them understand the message easily and have enough time to react accordingly. The ITS Program sections and regional Traffic must approve all PVMS messages used on signs located on provincial highways. NOTE When not in use, the PVMS should be turned parallel to the flow of traffic so that motorists do not see its screen. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 151 SECTION 4 The format must be developed so that drivers can quickly determine if a message does not apply to them. For example, placing the name of the connecting highway first in the message immediately targets only drivers who are interested in using the identified road. Units of Information/Major Words A unit of information answers a specific question, such as, ‘What happened?’, ‘Where did it happen?’, and ‘What are its effects?’ For example, each of the following is a unit of information. What Highway? 417 WEST Where? AT MAITLAND What is happening? LANE REDUCTION When? At 10 PM A typical weather warning message is shown below: DRIFTING SNOW POSSIBLE DRIVE WITH CAUTION • The first phase, or message segment, contains three major words: “DRIFTING”, “SNOW” and “POSSIBLE”. • The second phase has two major words: “DRIVE” and “CAUTION”. • The word “WITH” is not considered a major word. “DRIVE WITH CAUTION” could also be considered as a unit of information because it expresses a single thought. Multi-Phase Messages As mentioned above, a phase refers to a message segment which is individually displayed. For example, FIRST PHASE SECOND PHASE “Maitland Exit” “Closed Until 9 am” Human factor studies have shown that for most drivers: • There is not enough reading time for more than two phases of information. • They are unable to retain more than two phases of information. Therefore, a maximum of two phases per sign is permitted under normal circumstances. A maximum of two phases per sign is permitted under normal circumstances. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4152 SECTION 4 When designing a two-phase message: • The wording must make sense regardless of which phase the driver reads first. • Each phase should contain a complete thought. • Multi-word units of information shall not be broken across phases. The following are message guidelines for the number of phases that are required to convey a

    message:
    

One-Phase PVMS: • Line 1—Describe effect to the road or access. • Line 2—Identify location or distance ahead. • Line 3—Provide motorist instruction. Two-Phase PVMS: • Phase 1—Describe effect to the road or access. • Phase 2—Provide motorist instruction. Use of Alternate Display Techniques Several alternate display techniques, usually associated with advertising signs, are technically possible

    in the control of PVMS for highway use; however, are not allowed for MTO PVMS installations. These
    

    include:
    

• Message flashing, where the message cycles on and off several times a minute to draw the observer’s attention to the message. This can occur with all or part of the message. Flashing messages take longer to read than static messages and are not to be used. • Message alternating, where two physically separate signs, which are close enough to be perceived by drivers as a pair, are used to convey parts of a message. Apart from bilingual applications, this approach is inconsistent with other types of signing on the highway. Message alternating has been shown to be confusing to drivers and shall be avoided. • Message scrolling, where the message appears to scroll from right to left across the screen or top to bottom to accommodate longer messages than otherwise possible. This technique requires significantly more attention from drivers as they cannot just glance at the message but must watch it scroll. This constitutes a potentially hazardous distraction and shall not be implemented. Message alternating has shown to be confusing to drivers and shall be avoided. NOTE Flashing messages take longer to read than static messages and are not to be used. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 153 SECTION 4 Signing in Designated Bilingual Areas All French translations must be approved by the road authority. Given the current industry standard, many PVMS can display three lines of text. As a result, two approaches for PVMS messages are permissible for use in Ontario’s designated bilingual areas.

1.  From a human factor’s perspective, the preferred approach is to use two PVMS – one for each language.
2.  The other permissible approach, though less effective, is to use a single PVMS to display the two-phase messages, where each phase is used for one language. To determine which approach to use, it is necessary to review all the messages intended for the location. If they can all be fit on one phase for English and one phase for French, then a single sign will suffice. Otherwise, two signs are required. In the case of two signs, each with a different language, drivers do not need to read both signs and the spacing between should be 75 metres. However, care must be taken at setup, so the first sign does not block the view of the second sign. If this is the case, the distance between the signs may need to be increased. The sign that displays the English message should always be set up first to provide consistency across the province.

Message clarity is significantly impacted. 4.2.11.4 Site Selection and Installation of PVMS The location of PVMS must ensure adequate visibility, roadside safety, and consideration to the availability of power and communication to install PVMS. Visibility • Horizontal and vertical geometries of a highway will have the greatest effect on the visibility of a sign. Whenever possible, the sign should be placed on a tangent section of the highway, while maintaining the intent of the message content. All French translations must be approved by the road authority. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4154 SECTION 4 • On freeways, message signs should be located 1000 metres to 1500 metres upstream of interchange decision points. • On arterial roads, message signs should be located 600 metres to 1000 metres upstream of decision points. • If multiple PVMS are located close together, but show only one language, a minimum longitudinal distance of 150 metres should separate the signs to allow drivers to read and process the first sign before they see the second one. • PVMS should not obstruct and should not be obstructed by, any existing signs or other objects. • PVMS need to be sufficiently away from nearby ground-mounted static signs so that motorists can focus their attention on the message without being distracted by other signs. • When placing a sign within the limits of a construction zone, ensure that it does not interfere with construction operations. Roadside Safety • A PVMS can become a roadside hazard to the travelling public. Therefore, PVMS should be placed outside the clear zone for a given section of highway or placed behind a section of guide rail. • The PVMS should be far enough behind a guide rail to account for the deflection angle of the given guide rail style. • When locating the PVMS, it is important to remember that the sign head is significantly wider than the trailer when in the display position. On municipal highways if the PVMS cannot be protected by a guardrail or barrier, then it is recommended that orange cones or drums be used. Installation • The signs shall be installed level. • The bottom of the sign display shall be at least 1.5 metres above the adjacent edge of the pavement elevation. • PVMS shall be set at the proper angle to traffic to maximize the time that drivers are viewing the sign in the centre of the viewing angle. With such a narrow angle of good

    luminance, sign positioning (angle) in work zones becomes critical.
    

• A sight tube for aiming the device is required on new PVMS. The sign should be aimed such that the message is legible from at least 300 metres for freeway applications and at least 200 metres for arterial road applications. PVMS should not obstruct and should not be obstructed by, any existing signs or other objects. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 155 SECTION 4

    4.2.11.5 Flashing Arrow Board (TC-12)
    

• FLASHING ARROW BOARDS are used to increase conspicuity, to indicate lane closures in stationary or mobile work operations and guide traffic along the desired path. Flashing Arrow Boards TC-12 IN LEFT ARROW MODE IN BAR MODE IN RIGHT ARROW MODE

    Minimum Background Reflectivity: High Intensity (Type III/IV)
    

Purpose The FLASHING ARROW BOARD is used to alert motorist of lane or shoulder closures. Operation FLASHING ARROW BOARDS are used on urban and rural freeways, or other multi-lane major highways, to warn and guide traffic through a work area, while also enhancing safety to the work crew in conditions such as: • Day or night closures. • Mobile operations for maintenance or construction. • High-risk operations requiring more elaborate means to warn and guide traffic through a work area. TC-12 are mounted on motor vehicles or trailers. The signs can be illuminated in four different modes:

1.  Single arrow mode (right) - Stationary Operations -indicates that a lane change to the right is required. Mobile Operations - also indicates that drivers are to keep right.
2.  Single arrow mode (left) - Stationary Operations - indicates that a lane change to the left is required. Mobile Operations - also indicates that drivers are to keep left.
3.  Both arrows mode - should only be used under low speed (60 km/h or less) traffic conditions. Both arrow mode indicates that a lane change to the left or the right is required. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4156 SECTION 4
4.  Bar mode - Is used downstream of a TC-12 in arrow mode in a closed lane or shoulder to Identify the work area or work vehicle.

    Conditions:
    

General A TC-12 must not be used in arrow mode with:

    • A Traffic Control Person (TCP), if the proximity of the TC-12 may reduce the visibility of the
    

TCP. In this situation, the TC-12 must also not be used in bar mode.

    • An AFAD (Automated Flagger Assistance Device).
    

    • A Traffic control signal (portable or temporary).
    

    • The YIELD TO ONCOMING TRAFFIC (Rb-91) sign.
    

The TC-12 sign must be mounted at a minimum of 1.5 m above the highway to qualify as a replacement device for other traffic control devices. Multi-lane Highways Stationary Operations: • Within the coned area, one TC-12 in arrow mode must be used at the end of each taper to indicate that one lane change is required. • Any additional TC-12, in the same lane downstream, must be in bar mode to indicate that

    the vehicle/trailer on which the TC-12 is mounted is in a closed lane (or on the shoulder),
    

and that no further lane changes are required. • One TC-12 in arrow mode may also be used as an advance warning sign on the shoulder. Mobile Operations: • A TC-12 in arrow mode is used on sign trucks and Buffer Vehicles to indicate the direction in which the traffic is permitted to pass and to reinforce the need to keep to the side of the vehicle. • When a sign truck/Buffer Vehicle is following a work vehicle, at a distance of Lateral

    Intrusion Deterrence Gap (LIDG), the TC-12 on the work vehicle shall be in bar mode
    

indicating a lane closure as illustrated in layouts US-14, DS-14, US-12, DS-12, FS-5, and FS-6. • When there is no sign truck/Buffer Vehicle following the work vehicle, the TC-12 on the work vehicle shall be in arrow mode as illustrated in US-13 and DS-13. The TC-12 on all

    sign truck/Buffer Vehicle(s) upstream of the work vehicle shall be in arrow mode for multi-
    

lane highways mobile operations. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 157 SECTION 4 • TC-12 should be used in bar mode for shoulder work, except during setup/removal of traffic control devices. In mobile operations, TC-12 signs are used in the arrow mode on sign trucks and Buffer Vehicles on multi-lane highways to reinforce the need to keep to the side of the vehicle. Two Lane Highways Stationary Operations: • The TC-12 must be used in bar mode only. The TC-12 must not be used in arrow mode. • TC-12 should be used in bar mode for shoulder work, except during setup/removal of traffic control devices. Mobile operations: • The TC-12 must be used in bar mode. Visibility Distance

    Required visibility distances (day or night) for the TC-12 is as follows:
    

• For NPRS of 90 km/h or greater, the distance must be 900 m with the flashing lights on, and 350 m for the recognizable arrow or bar shape. • For NPRS of 70 km/h to 80 km/h, the distance must be 600 m with the flashing lights on, and 250 m for the recognizable arrow or bar shape. • For NPRS of 60 km/h and lower, the distance must be 450 m with the flashing lights on, and 175 m for the recognizable arrow or bar shape. Sign Panel Sign Panel requirements for the TC-12 is as follows:

    • The black arrow silhouette design and orange reflective background (to act as a fail-safe
    

    device) must be used on all TC-12.
    

• The panel shall be one-piece design, equipped with remote-controlled mode activation mechanisms mounted on the panel. • The actuation time of the mode activation mechanisms from the closed position to the open position or vice versa shall be 10 seconds maximum.

    • The arrows and arrow shaft (bar) shall be black in colour.
    

• The background must be Type III/IV, high intensity, retroreflective orange sheeting, to provide for fail-safe operations in case of power failure. The TC-12 sign must not be used in arrow mode on two-lane highways. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4158 SECTION 4 Sign Panel Lighting Sign panel lighting requirements for the TC-12 sign is as follows: • The sign panel should incorporate four illumination modes: right arrow, left arrow, both arrows, and bar mode. Only one mode shall be visible at a time to the approaching traffic, and only the lights within the operating mode shall be visible. • The amber lights on all TC-12 must flash simultaneously or sequentially to increase the conspicuity and attention-getting value of the arrow. For night use, the light intensity must be reduced. • For use on freeways, the TC-12 must have 15 to 19 amber halogen lamps, or LED lamps, arranged in the form of an arrow that meet the required visibility distances as prescribed above or equivalent as approved by the road authority.

    • The smaller TC-12 (non-freeway, striper, emergency) must have sufficient lights to provide
    

distinct arrow and bar shapes with a minimum of 12 lamps for non-freeways and 14 lamps for stripers.

    • The arrow head and shaft shall flash simultaneously (arrow on/off). Alternatively, the
    

arrow shaft and head may flash sequentially, with the arrow shaft coming on first and then the arrow head, the shaft remaining on so that at the end of the cycle, the complete

    arrow appears (shaft and head).
    

    • A photo-electric cell with 110 lux (10-foot candelas) sensitivity for the night dimmer shall
    

be supplied to automatically reduce lamp intensity. • The lights shall flash approximately 40 to 50 times per minute. The “ON” phase must be on for 50% of the cycle time. Electronic Controller Electronic controller requirements for the TC-12 is as follows:

    • The controller shall operate the following functions (from inside the cab, if truck-
    

    mounted). Note: some of these functions may be automatically adjusted:
    

⚪ Left flashing arrow. ⚪ Right flashing arrow. ⚪ Bar mode. ⚪ Both arrow mode, if present. ⚪ Specified flashes per minute. ⚪ Light intensity. ⚪ Remote-controlled mode activation mechanisms. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 159 SECTION 4 Crashworthiness Trailer-mounted TC-12 located on the highway must be crashworthy. • The design should be lightweight with the centre of gravity of the unit near or below that of impacting vehicles. • If impacted, detached elements, fragments, or other debris from the device should not penetrate or show potential for penetrating the passenger compartments of vehicles or present undue hazard to the public or workers. Size Non-Freeways: • 600 mm x 750 mm ⚪ Bar/arrow shaft size 150 mm x 750 mm, minimum 12 amber halogen or LED lamps.

    Freeways:
    

• 1200 mm x 2100 mm ⚪ Bar/arrow shaft size 300 mm x 2100 mm, 15 to 19 amber halogen or LED lamps. • 600 mm x 150 mm - striper truck mounted. ⚪ Bar/arrow shaft size 150 mm x 1500 mm, minimum 14 amber halogen or LED lamps. ⚪ May be used for freeway paving operations, freeway patrol, or freeway emergency response only. 4.2.11.6 Dynamic Speed Display Sign Purpose

    Dynamic Speed Display Signs (DSD) are implemented where there is a desire to reduce the operating
    

speed. Operation DSD Sign, where the vehicle speed is measured by radar and displayed to the driver on a dynamic message board, has shown in some applications to reduce 85th percentile speeds by an additional 4 to 8 km/h over the reduction caused by static signs alone. DSD may also display the posted regulatory speed sign or the advisory speed sign. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4160 SECTION 4 When drivers see their speed displayed, they: • May be genuinely surprised that they are exceeding the speed limit and may reduce their speed. • May be uncertain as to whether a sign that shows their speed means that enforcement is nearby and may reduce speed to avoid a potential fine. • May increase speed. The use of DSD signs are most effective when: • Multiple DSD signs are staggered through long work zones. • Supported by ongoing police enforcement, especially for long duration use. • Signs are strategically placed in relation to the location where the speed change is desired and relative to other traffic control devices. Road authority approval and enforcement consultation should be obtained prior to the use of speed display signs. Condition Dynamic speed display may be used when: • The work duration is Short Duration or Long Duration.

    • Traffic Control Persons are present;
    

    • Work zone speeds cause significant hazard; or
    

• Drivers have the tendency to disregard the speed limit at the location. Dynamic speed display should not be used: • On high speed - high volume roads as the display changes too rapidly for motorists to make a connection to the themselves. • If they will distract motorist attention from more important warning and guidance signage through a temporary condition. • For one lane of a multi-lane highway. • For prolonged periods without regular enforcement. Dynamic speed display must not be used: • On multiple lanes open in the same direction of travel as it will be unclear which vehicles speed will be displayed. • When there is no significant concern due to vehicle speed. Dynamic Speed Display signs should not be used for one lane of a multi-lane highway. NOTE Dynamic Speed Display signs should not be used for prolonged periods without regular enforcement. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 161 SECTION 4 Location of DSD should: • Be 100 m following a posted regulatory/advisory speed change or 100 m following the end of taper for a lane closure. DSD must: • Be placed outside the clear zone for a given section of highway or placed behind barrier. • Be far enough behind barrier to account for the deflection angle of the given barrier style. • Follow manufacturer specifications.

    Refer to OTM Book 10 (Dynamic Message Signs) for guidelines on placement of DSD.
    

4.2.11.7 Supplementary Flashing Lights Purpose Supplementary Flashing Lights are used to attract the attention of drivers to the sign message or identify a hazard or obstruction. Construction, maintenance, and other activities within a highway often create conditions that are particularly hazardous at night when the vision of highway users is reduced. There are both daytime and night-time situations where it is necessary to increase the target value and impact of warning signs by installing amber flashing devices over these signs. Condition • Flashing devices alone, with the exception of TC-12, must not be used for channelization purposes as they may obscure the intended vehicle path. • All flashing lights must operate on a lower setting of light intensity during hours of darkness. • Flashing lights must not be used in conjunction with PVMS. Flashing lights must not be used in conjunction with PVMS. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4162 SECTION 4 4.2.11.8 Queue-End Warning Queue-end warning is used to allow drivers to slow down in advance of reaching the queue and to avoid rear-end collisions at the upstream of the work area. If a pre-determined queue length is known, a static sign, such as TC-20, is used to inform drivers of the queue ahead. Alternatively, if the queue length is being monitored dynamically, a system of traffic sensors may be integrated to a dynamic message sign, such as PVMS. The sensor to detect a queue-end should be listed as MTO’s Designated

    Sources of Materials (DSM) for MTO projects or be pre-approved by the road authority. If a desired
    

sensor is not listed as MTO’s DSM or is not pre-approved by the road authority, MTO or the road authority should provide minimum requirement specifications. Queue-end warning may be used when:

    • The work duration is Short Duration or Long Duration;
    

• Highway geometries approaching the work zone have horizontal or vertical curves that

    restrict queue visibility; or
    

• Unexpected queues build upstream of the approach area. Queue-end warning should not be used: • When there is no anticipated buildup of queues. Figure 4.5 illustrates an example setup of the static queue-end warning. Static signs are placed at appropriate locations based on the anticipated queue length. Figure 4.6 illustrates an example setup of the dynamic queue-end warning system. A set of 4 approved queue detecting sensors from MTO’s DSM and a PVMS are installed at pre-defined locations. Additional PVMS may be placed as required with additional sensors installed. Road authority approval and consultation must be obtained prior to the use of the dynamic queue-end warning system. Both, Figure 4.5 and Figure 4.6, are supplementary figures to show how queue-end warnings would look. In practice, queue-end warnings must be integrated with other appropriate traffic control layouts.

BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 165 SECTION 4 4.3 Advance Notification, Advance Warning, and Alternate Route Signs Section 4.3.1 provides information on the three key traffic management strategies, that address driver expectations and traffic demand during temporary conditions. Section 4.3.2 provides information on using queue-end warning to alert drivers of potential queues ahead of time. Physical specifications and message guidelines are provided for the Road Closing/Restriction TC-64

    sign (Section 4.2.10) and Portable Variable Message Sign (Section 4.2.11) devices, which are used to
    

provide advance notification, advance warning, and alternate route, as well as information on site selection and installation of these message signs.

    4.3.1 Temporary Conditions Traffic Management (TCTM) Manual
    

The MTO’s TCTM Manual promotes uniformity of treatment in the design, selection, application, and operation of temporary conditions traffic management systems on provincial highways. The Manual encourages consistency in safe and efficient TCTM practices by providing principles, policies,

    standards, guidance, and working examples; and is primarily intended for those with responsibility
    

for the planning, design, installation, management, supervision, or enforcement of work zone traffic management and control measures. The TCTM Manual defines three key traffic management strategies to address the management of driver expectations and traffic demand during temporary conditions:

1.  Advanced notification.
2.  Advanced warning.
3.  Alternative routing. These strategies, as they pertain to signing during temporary conditions, are defined below. The three key signing strategies function most effectively under certain circumstances. Criteria for their use is outlined below. For more information on these strategies and their applications, refer to the TCTM Manual.

    4.3.1.1 Advance Notification Signing (ANS)
    

Signing installed on an affected route prior to the establishment of a work zone. Used to forewarn regular users of a route that work is planned in the near future. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4166 SECTION 4 Characteristics • Temporary or time-oriented signs that raise awareness regarding a future, planned work activity before it is scheduled to occur. • Effectively communicates the time, duration, extent, and potential impact of the planned work activity. • Located on the affected facility, upstream of the work zone.

    • Primarily aimed at recurring highway users (i.e., daily commuters or weekend recreational
    

    travellers), allowing them to alter route plans.
    

• Typically a TC-64 ROAD CLOSING/RESTRICTION, TC-65 ROAD CLOSING or PVMS. Criteria for Use ANS should be used when critical capacity will be reduced, or navigational freedom will be restricted on: • Commuter and commercial routes due to: ⚪ Continuous activity exceeding 48 hours duration.

    ⚪ Part-time, recurring activity during the same period (i.e., nightly lane closures) twice
    

or more over a span of 7 consecutive days. • Recreational routes due to: ⚪ Activity at any time during peak travel periods of a holiday weekend. ⚪ Continuous activity exceeding 7 days duration.

    ⚪ Part-time, recurring activity (i.e., nightly weekend closures) on two or more
    

consecutive weekends.

    4.3.1.2 Advance Warning Signing (AWS)
    

Signing installed on an affected route to inform road users of the scope, extent, and duration of a planned work activity. Work may be continuous or reoccurring. Characteristics • Situational or location-oriented signs that raise awareness regarding the location, extent, duration, and degree of encroachment of an ongoing activity. • Provide near “real-time” information regarding recurring activities such as lane closures. • Located on the affected facility, an adequate distance upstream of the work zone. • Raise driver awareness well in advance of the tail of the queue when work is in progress. • Allow drivers to exit the facility and seek an alternative route. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 167 SECTION 4 • Typically TC-66 HIGHWAY SECTION CLOSED, TC-67 STREET SECTION CLOSED or a PVMS. Criteria for Use AWS is relevant to all users of the route at the present time, therefore, more broadly applicable than ANS. AWS should be used where: • There has been prior use of ANS. • Critical capacity is reduced, or navigational freedom is restricted due to: ⚪ Continuous activity exceeding 48 hours duration.

    ⚪ Part-time, recurring activity during the same period (i.e., nightly lane closures) twice
    

or more within 7 days.

    4.3.1.3 Alternate Route Signing (ARS)
    

Signing installed on an affected route describing an alternative route to either reach a destination or to bypass congestion. The alternative route itself receives no temporary signing. Characteristics • In combination with AWS, allow unfamiliar drivers to bypass the affected location. • An alternative route is only termed a “detour” if it is formally signed with temporary trailblazers throughout the route. Unsigned routes are simply alternative routes. • “Intercept” drivers on routes parallel to or crossing the affected route destined for the affected facility, channeling them onto alternative routes. • Guide drivers to exit the affected facility along a detour or alternative route, returning them to their original route downstream of the work zone. • Typically TC-62 ALTERNATE HIGHWAY ROUTE sign or two phase PVMS. Criteria for Use ARS on all types of highways should be used where: • Any restriction is imposed on navigational freedom. Some measure of access must be maintained if alternative routes are unavailable.

    ⚪ Directional information (i.e., Use Keele to Wilson) provided at the restriction site may
    

be enough if the alternative routes are very straightforward and obvious. ⚪ Signing at decision-points along the detour route is required if the alternative routes are not straightforward and obvious. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4168 SECTION 4 • Critical capacity is reduced due to: ⚪ Continuous activity exceeding 7 days duration.

    ⚪ Part-time activity recurring four or more times during the same period (i.e., nightly
    

    lane closures) within 7 days.
    

• An AWS sign is located upstream. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 169 SECTION 4 4.4 Devices to Regulate and Control the Flow of Traffic In some situations, guidance and information devices alone may not be adequate to ensure the safe and efficient movement of traffic. For example, where one lane is available for traffic in both directions, or where guidance through a complicated work zone is necessary, devices to control the flow of traffic are required. The following sections provide descriptions of flow control devices, including their general application and limitations as well as guidelines and specifications once they have been identified, based on the fundamental and guiding principles described in Sections 2 and 3, and/or through a layout. These sections are particularly relevant to: • Designers, contractors, and road authorities in preparing or ordering a schedule of devices. • Any person who is deploying the devices in reference to layouts. • Supervisors or enforcement officers in evaluating the compliance of devices on site. 4.4.1 Yield to Oncoming Traffic The YIELD TO ONCOMING TRAFFIC sign must be used only on two-lane, two-way highways, where only one lane is available for traffic. The sign advises highway users that they are required to give the right of way to oncoming traffic in the shared lane.

    As specified in OTM Book 5 (Regulatory Signs), the sign may be used on highways where:
    

• Traffic volume is low. • The work area is short. • There is no obstructed visibility.

    4.4.2 Traffic Control Persons (TCP)
    

    Traffic Control Persons (TCP) are workers who manually regulate vehicle traffic using a TC-22
    

    TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGN (STOP/SLOW Paddle), and often arm motions, to prevent conflicts between
    

workers, work zone activities, opposing highway traffic, work vehicles, and pedestrians. The TCP is responsible for: • Protecting construction workers and the motoring public by safely regulating traffic flow and directing traffic through a work zone.

    • Stopping traffic whenever required by the progress of the work; otherwise, to keep traffic
    

moving at reduced speeds to avoid tie-ups and delays. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4170 SECTION 4 • Allowing construction to safely and efficiently proceed. • Warning workers of impending danger. • Ensuring that construction equipment does not impact public traffic. • Focusing on the traffic control task and not performing other work while directing traffic.

    Adequate safety precautions, as prescribed in the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA), must
    

be taken to protect TCP from any hazards to which they may be exposed. Safety precautions include: • Personal protective clothing. • Equipment and devices. • Appropriate training. • Additional protective measures necessary to mitigate risks imposed by vehicular traffic. +NOTE The safety of TCP must be addressed during the planning stages of traffic control. 4.4.2.1 Specifications for Use of TCP Table 4.5 Recommended Use for TCP Use Roadway Speed Duration

NOTE An additional TCP or two-way communication devices are required on sections where TCP are not in sight of each other. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 171 SECTION 4 TCP must not be used on: • Any highway with a TC-12 FLASHING ARROW BOARD. • A freeway or staged freeway including ramps. TCP must never: +NOTE

    • Impact the operation of traffic control signals (temporary or permanent).
    

• Be positioned or operate within 30 metres of an intersection with

    operating traffic control signals. (Only Police Officers can control
    

    intersections with operating traffic control signals. (Refer to Section 175
    

    (9) of the HTA)).
    

Refer to the two decision matrices, Table 4.10 and Table 4.11 in Section 4.4.6, to determine if the use of TCP is appropriate for the temporary condition. On highway sections where TCP are not in sight of each other, an additional TCP and/or two-way communication devices are required to relay instructions to the TCP at each end. 4.4.2.2 TCP Qualifications and Equipment General qualifications for a TCP include: +NOTE • Sound health, good vision and hearing, and mental and physical alertness. • Mature judgement and pleasant manner. • Ability to judge speed and distance of oncoming vehicles. • Compliance with the OHSA requirement of a competent worker.

    • Possession of a valid driver’s licence (preferably).
    

• The ability to give motorists simple directions, explain hazards, and answer questions. • The ability to appreciate, understand, and respect the responsibilities of the job. TCP must be given written and oral instructions about their duties in a language they can understand. TCP should never be positioned or operate within 30 metres of an intersection with operating traffic control signals. NOTE TCP must be given written and oral instructions about their duties in a language that they can understand. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4172 SECTION 4 Clothing TCP must wear a garment that covers at least his or her upper body and meet the requirements of O.Reg. 213/91 Section 69.1 under the OHSA. • The garment shall be fluorescent blaze or international orange in colour. • On the front and the back, there shall be two yellow stripes that are 5 centimetres wide. The yellow area shall total at least 500 square centimetres on the front and at least 570 square centimetres on the back. • On the front, the stripes shall be arranged vertically and centred and shall be approximately 225 millimetres apart, measured from the centre of each stripe. On the back, they shall be arranged in a diagonal “X” pattern. • The stripes shall be retro-reflective and fluorescent. • If the garment is a vest, it shall have adjustable fit and shall also have a side and front tear- away feature.

    • For more detailed information on High Visibility Safety Apparel (HVSA), refer to CSA
    

Z96-15 standard. TCP also require the following:

    • A hard hat that is Canadian Standards Association (CSA) certified Class E – Type I or II
    

hard hat. If used at night, it is recommended the hard hat have reflective tape that does

    not alter the dielectric properties of the safety hat and is visible from all angles (minimum
    

    of 80 cm² recommended).
    

    • Safety boots that are CSA-certified, Grade 1 (green triangular CSA patch on the outside,
    

    green rectangular label on the inside).
    

• Eye protection, e.g., clear safety glasses for night or overcast, tinted safety glasses when sunny, consider goggles for extreme dust and wind. • Retro-reflective silver stripes encircling each arm and leg or equivalent side visibility- enhancing stripes with a minimum area of 50 cm² per side during night-time hours. Tools

    The standard TC-22 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGN (STOP/SLOW Paddle) with an extension handle must be
    

used by TCP for hand signalling to direct traffic. The use of flags is prohibited. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 173 SECTION 4 WORK AREA 5–30 m + Taper SEE TCP TABLE WORK AREA 5–30 m + Taper SEE TCP TABLE

    TCP may be used for night-time operations; however, this should be avoided if possible. Traffic
    

Control Plans using TCP for night-time operations require approval from the road authority. For night-time traffic control, TCP require: • A well-lit TCP station. Appropriate lighting must be provided so that the TCP is clearly visible to traffic in both directions. Illumination from above is generally more effective than from the side.

    • A TC-22 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGN (STOP/SLOW Paddle) and a flashlight with a red or
    

orange cone attachment with spare batteries. • The STOP side of the paddle may be enhanced with alternating flashing red LED lightbars installed horizontally above and/or below the outer border of the STOP sign, as an option to the standard TC-22.

    • The alternating flashing red light(s) are to be briefly activated by the TCP as vehicles
    

approach to enhance conspicuity. • A two-way communication device. Voice activated radios are recommended to free the TCP's hand for using the STOP/SLOW Paddles and flashlight simultaneously. • Advance warning signs, which may be enhanced with amber beacons when TCP are used at night.

    • Automated Flagger Assistance Devices (AFAD) or Portable Temporary Traffic Signal
    

    (PTTS) should be considered for high risk situations.

TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4174 SECTION 4 4.4.2.3 TCP Position and Location When a TCP is on duty, the TC-21 TRAFFIC CONTROL PERSON AHEAD sign must always be used. The sign is placed in advance of the TCP at the distance shown in an appropriate layout in Section 6. The TC-21 sign must be removed when the TCP is not on duty. +NOTE TCP must be positioned and operate in a manner which will not conflict with other traffic control devices such as:

1.  STOP signs. ⚪ STOP signs must be covered on any approach that is controlled by a TCP.
2.  Traffic signals. ⚪ Sufficient vehicle storage should be available between an intersection and the TCP to accommodate expected queues without extending into an intersection with operating signals.

    ⚪ Where there are operating traffic signals (permanent or temporary)
    

at an intersection, TCP must not be used within 30 metres of the stop bar on any approach. 3. Railway crossing signals.

    Lane closure tapers for one-lane and two-way lane control scenarios (when TCP or other traffic
    

    control devices are used) range from 15 metres to 30 metres (based on Normal Posted Regulatory
    

    Speed ), as shown in Table 4.6, below.
    

    Table 4.6 also shows appropriate lengths of longitudinal buffer areas (LBA) at various NPRS.
    

For one-lane, two-way lane control scenarios, LBA: • Should be used for all NPRS if space permits. • Are required for NPRS > 60 km/h. • Are recommended, if space permits, for NPRS < 60 km/h. Additionally, TCP must be positioned 10 metres from the first cone of the taper. This distance remains constant at all NPRS. TCP must be positioned and operate in a manner which will not conflict with other traffic control devices. NOTE A TCP must not be used within 30 metres of the stop bar on any approach of an operating traffic signal.

Contractors are not permitted to turn off traffic signals to allow the use of TCP at an intersection. The turning off of traffic signals must be approved and executed by the road authority. +NOTE TCP must be clearly visible to approaching motorists at all times. This can be achieved by • Locating the TCP for good visibility and contrast. ⚪ The TCP should not stand in the shadows or where the sun impedes visibility. ⚪ Colour contrast should be maintained between the TCP and the background, to every extent possible. • Preventing other illuminated or reflective objects from distracting the visual attention of motorists away from the TCP. Typical TCP locations are shown in Figure 4.8 Positioning of Traffic Control Persons for straight highway, hill, and curve situations, and in the layouts in Section 6. When a TCP is on duty, they must also: • Be alert, standing at all times. • Be aware of an escape route, which should be planned before going on duty. • Face oncoming traffic and not turn their back on moving traffic. • Stand alone and not mingle with workers or the public. • Stand just outside the lane of traffic. • Stand where they can be seen to give approaching traffic adequate time to respond, and where they can see for 150 metres. +NOTE

    • Remove or cover all signs that indicate a TCP (TC-21 TRAFFIC CONTROL
    

    PERSON AHEAD) when a TCP is not present to control traffic, including
    

lunch and other breaks. • Not perform any other work while directing traffic. The turning off of traffic signals must be approved and executed by the road authority. NOTE When a TCP is not present, including lunch and other breaks, the TC-21 sign must be removed or covered. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4176 SECTION 4 • Be alert for emergency vehicles, which have “priority rights,” and allow them to pass as quickly as possible. • Conduct their operations so as not to impact nearby traffic control and railway crossing signal systems, and not override or conflict with them.

When stopping traffic, the TCP must: • Display the TC-22 STOP Paddle sign to the driver, extending the sign into the lane of oncoming traffic, giving the driver enough warning for a safe and comfortable stop. • Stand off the travelled portion of the highway until the first vehicle has come to a stop. • Move to a point on the highway where traffic in the queue can see him/her when traffic has stopped. • Ensure that opposing traffic has stopped and the last opposing vehicle has passed his/her post before moving traffic from a stopped position. When slowing traffic, the TCP must: • Display the TC-22 SLOW Paddle sign, slowly moving the sign back and forth, if necessary, using hand signals to wave traffic forward or to command a further reduction in speed. The most typical TCP situation involves two TCP. When two TCP are required: • Lines of communication must be established prior to the start of operations. • The two TCP must be able to see and hear each other or have two-way radios for proper communication. • One TCP should be the lead TCP and coordinate all activities. When using visual communications on curves or hills, a third TCP may be required to relay signals between the two TCP at the ends of the work area. A single TCP may be used to control traffic in work areas where:

    • The length of the closed lane is short (up to 50 metres).
    

    • Traffic volumes and speeds are low. (NPRS 60 km/h or lower)
    

• Visibility is good and in daylight hours only. This may only be done in such a way that it is effectively one-way control, such as where traffic in one direction has an unobstructed lane. In this case: • The TCP holds traffic in the obstructed lane until the unobstructed lane is clear of traffic. In this one-way control situation, the TCP serves the same function as the YIELD TO ONCOMING TRAFFIC sign. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4178 SECTION 4 4.4.3 Temporary Traffic Control Using Signals Signals may be used as an alternative to TCP to control the flow of traffic through a work zone. There are currently four different electronic traffic control devices, which incorporate signal heads, that can be used to control traffic under temporary conditions.

1.  Automated Flagger Assistance Devices.
2.  Portable Lane Control Signals.
3.  Portable Temporary Traffic Signals.
4.  Temporary Traffic Signals. Descriptions, guidelines, and specifications for their use on provincial highways are detailed in the sections below.

    4.4.3.1 Automated Flagger Assistance Devices (AFAD)
    

    An Automated Flagger Assistance Device (AFAD) as defined in Section 146.1 (7) of the Highway
    

Traffic Act as a self-contained, portable traffic control system that is operated remotely by a Traffic Control Person to control traffic movement and features a circular red lens, a circular yellow lens and

    a gate arm. This device should not be confused with a Portable Lane Control Signals (PLCS).
    

The AFAD is intended to be used as a supplement for TCP to control two way traffic on two lane highways which have been reduced to one lane during ID, VSD, or SD work. AFADs should only be operated by a TCP who has been trained on the use and operation of the

    AFAD, and the TCPs shall not leave the AFAD(s) unattended at any time while they are operational.
    

An AFAD should be considered where the safety of the TCP on the highway has been identified as a concern. Safety benefits include: • Operation by remote control allowing the TCP to stand off the highway and out of danger from passing vehicles or construction vehicles. • Increased visibility. Drivers may see an AFAD at a further distance than a TCP, providing them with more time to slow down and stop. However, compliance with an AFAD may not be as high as with a TCP. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 179 SECTION 4 Refer to the two decision matrices in Section 4.4.6, Table 4.10 and Table 4.11, to determine if the use of AFAD is appropriate for the temporary condition. NOTE Design Every AFAD shall consist of a gate arm, and a signal head that contains one red lens mounted above

    one amber lens and each lens shall be at least 30 cm in diameter (HTA Regulation 185/22).
    

The signal lenses shall be mounted with a black backboard that is not less than 85 cm in height and not less than 50 cm in width, has an orange retro-reflective border that must be a minimum of 2.5 cm in width and is placed such that the bottom of the backboard is at least two meters above the level of the roadway

    (HTA Regulation 185/22).
    

The gate arm shall be at least 2 meters in length and at least 10 cm wide and shall be covered on both sides with alternating vertical stripes of orange and black retro-reflective sheeting. When the gate arm is lowered, the bottom edge of the gate arm shall not be less than 110 cm but not more than 140 cm above the level of the

    roadway (HTA Regulation 185/22).
    

The AFAD should have a conflict monitoring capability that prevents illumination of the red and amber lenses at the same time. The Figure below illustrates the legal design requirements for an AFAD. Operation and Maintenance An AFAD shall not be operated such that the amber

    and red lens are illuminated at the same time (HTA
    

    Regulation 185/22).
    

For road users to proceed through the one-lane section, the AFAD shall display a flashing amber indication with the gate arm in the up position. To stop vehicles, the AFAD must first sequence to a solid amber indication with the gate arm remaining in the up position, which would then be followed by a solid red indication with the gate arm in the down

    position. (HTA Section 146(3.1) and (4.1)).
    

TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4180 SECTION 4 The solid amber display is a change interval used to warn road users they are about to lose their right of way and be required to stop. This solid amber change interval should be between 4 and 6 seconds in duration. Each lamp and each lens in the AFAD shall be maintained so that when the lamp is illuminated, the

    lens is clearly visible to approaching traffic for a distance of at least 165 meters (HTA Regulation
    

    185/22).
    

An AFAD shall not be operated unless a TCP is positioned close enough to the device to enable the TCP to immediately display a traffic control stop/slow paddle to approaching traffic if the device

    malfunctions (HTA Regulation 185/22). Based on this legal requirement, two TCPs are always required
    

and could operate the AFADs as follows:

1.  One TCP operates an AFAD at either end of the work zone, or
2.  One TCP operates an AFAD at one end of the work zone and the second TCP controls traffic with a TC-22 STOP/SLOW paddle at the other end of the work zone. For both options, the TCPs should be in constant communication with each other. If two AFADs are being used, the two devices can be connected. One TCP can control both AFADs to eliminate the possibility of conflicting commands being given to the devices. Both TCPs must still be close enough to their respective AFAD that they can see/recognize a malfunction and use a TC-22 STOP/SLOW paddle to control traffic if required. A TCP responsible for operating or monitoring the AFAD should position themselves off the roadway and upstream of the device so they can observe the signal display safely. A TCP shall not activate the flashing amber display until the last vehicle from the opposing direction has cleared the work zone. Placement An AFAD shall be placed on a highway such that the device's signal is to the right of, facing and

    clearly visible to approaching traffic (HTA Regulation 185/22).
    

An AFAD shall not be located at an intersection or pedestrian crossover and shall not be located in

    any place or manner so as to conflict with any traffic control signal system (HTA Regulation 185/22).
    

BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 181 SECTION 4 Traffic should be channeled into a single lane in advance of the AFAD by means of cones, barrels, and

    an Rb-25 (KEEP RIGHT sign)
    

Proper illumination is required when AFAD are used for night-time activities. The AFAD should be positioned in a location where the end of the arm reaches at least to the center of the lane being controlled. A 60 cm square fluorescent orange flag may be attached at, or near, the end of the gate arm to make the gate arm more conspicuous. If a contractor leaves the site, AFADs must be removed, and two-way flow of traffic resumed. Refer to the two decision matrices in Section 4.4.6, Table 4.10 and Table 4.11, to determine if the use of an AFAD is appropriate for the temporary condition. Signs The following signs shall be erected in front of an AFAD in the order as listed below as a driver

    approaches the work zone (HTA Regulation 185/22):
    

• An Rb-31 DO NOT PASS sign as prescribed in Regulation 615 of the HTA • An TC23B AUTOMATED FLAGGER ASSISTANCE DEVICE AHEAD sign. • An Rb-78 “STOP HERE ON RED SIGNAL sign indicating the location where the driver approaching an AFAD device is to bring their vehicle to a stop. These signs shall have a retroreflective background and be located to the right of, facing and clearly

    visible to approaching traffic (HTA Regulation 185/22).
    

Each sign shall be either: • ground mounted, where the bottom of the sign shall be between 1.5 meters and 2.5

    meters above the level of the roadway (HTA Regulation 185/22) or
    

• mounted on a portable stand, where the bottom edge of the sign shall be between 1.0

    meter and 2.5 meters above the roadway level (HTA Regulation 185/22).
    

If the AFAD is to be used in an area designated by the French Language Services Act and the

    municipality has passed a by-law under subsection 14(1) of that Act, the Rb-78 ‘STOP HERE ON RED
    

SIGNAL” sign must be replaced with a bilingual version. If however the AFAD is in an area designated by the French Language Services Act, but the municipality has not passed a by-law under subsection TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4182 SECTION 4

    14(1), of that Act, an English only, or a bilingual version of the Rb-79 STOP HERE ON RED SIGNAL sign
    

    can be used. (HTA Regulation 185/22).
    

Full signing for use of the AFAD should be in accordance with TS-19.

    4.4.3.2 Portable Lane Control Signals (PLCS)
    

    Portable Lane Control Signals (PLCS) consist of at least one vehicle traffic signal head, normally
    

mounted onto a movable pole/trailer, with programmable signal timing. The use of PLCS is an alternative to continuous flagging by TCP and are not to be confused with PTTS. Where PLCS are used, the following guidelines and specifications apply: • PLCS may only be used to control one-lane, two-way traffic flow for ID, VSD, or SD work where the posted speed is 60 km/h or less with a minimum signal visibility distance of 100 m, as shown in Table 4.7 Signal Visibility Table. Other situations require the use of Portable Temporary Traffic

    Signals (PTTS) see Section 4.4.4.3.
    

• PLCS are not to be used at an intersection or pedestrian crossover. • PLCS are only to be used where there is no conflict with any existing signals or traffic control systems. • PLCS must be removed and two-way flow of traffic resumed whenever the contractor leaves the site. • Due to the temporary nature of these devices, legal drawings are not

    required by law; however, these devices must only be operated while
    

the contractor is on site. • PLCS must be installed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 606 in the HTA, which covers the physical and signage requirements for these devices. • Full illumination must exist if the closure continues at night. • PLCS systems consist of at least one traffic signal head, normally mounted on movable poles/trailers at a minimum height of 2.75 metres from the highway surface to the bottom of the heads as shown in Figure 4.9 Portable Lane Control Signal. • PLCS with two signal heads are recommended, where practicable, with the second signal head located in the standard secondary head location. • Phasing must be two-phase only, with the all red clearance interval sufficiently long to clear the previous approach lane of all vehicular traffic while travelling at the desired operating speed. The use of PLC is an alternative to continuous flagging by TCP, and not to be confused with PTTS. NOTE PLCS may only be used to control one-lane, two-way traffic flow for ID, VSD, or SD work where the posted speed is 60 km/h or less. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 183 SECTION 4 Figure 4.9 Portable Lane Control Signal • Communication between the signal heads on opposite ends of the lane closure must be provided in order to prevent conflicting displays. • Should conflicting displays occur, the system must ensure that both directions receive a solid red signal indication. Figure 4.10 Signal Timing Calculations Examples provides an example of signal timing calculations. Further information can be found in OTM Book 12. • PLCS must be placed to the right of and facing traffic and used only under conditions where the signal lights are clearly visible to an approaching motorist such that the vehicle can be brought to a safe stop at the expected approach speeds • Intensity of the signal lamps must be maintained in such manner that the lights are clearly visible for a distance of at least

    100 metres (minimum requirement in the HTA).
    

• Access points or side streets within the one-lane section controlled by the PLCS must be controlled by TCP who are working in conjunction with the equipment. 500 mm 200 mm Lens Signal Backboard Yellow 1000 mm 2.75 m Signal Head • The signal system must be preceded by the following three signs:

    4.4.3.3 Portable Temporary Traffic Signals (PTTS)
    

    Portable Temporary Traffic Signals (PTTS) consist of two standard traffic signal heads mounted on
    

movable trailers. Where PTTS are used, the following guidelines and specifications apply: • The road authority must approve the use of PTTS so they can monitor their operation and request that the contractor adjust the timing of the device if traffic flow is adversely affected • For ID, VSD, and SD work, PTTS must be installed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 606 in the HTA, which covers the physical and signage requirements. Driver action is prescribed by Section 146 in the HTA. • PTTS may be used as lane control signals for ID, VSD, or SD work on highways with a NPRS greater than 60 km/h or for long duration work. • For LD work: ⚪ PTTS must be installed to meet the requirements of Regulation 626 and Section 144 of the HTA.

    ⚪ PTTS should only be used for a maximum of 8 months (April - November), as
    

maintenance and reliability concerns have been identified during the winter months. Outside this time period, the operation should return to normal two-way traffic flow. ⚪ A cost comparison is recommended to show that it is more cost effective to use solar powered PTTS as opposed to temporary traffic signals. • PTTS must not be located in any place or manner so as to conflict with any existing signals or traffic control systems.

    • Conventional Temporary Traffic Signals (TTS, i.e. signals on span wire)
    

must be used instead of PTTS at entrances, truck access routes, or pedestrian crossings. If time of day functions are required due to known

    variances in traffic patterns (i.e., different maximum green times due to
    

    long weekend traffic patterns), a conventional temporary traffic signal is
    

required. +NOTE • PTTS may be used as an alternative to TCP. • Other traffic control devices required to supplement PTTS include: ⚪ Warning signs. ⚪ Regulatory signs. ⚪ Temporary pavement markings, and/or ⚪ Channelizing devices. PTTS may be used as an alternative to TCP. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 185 SECTION 4 • PTTS may not be used if a side street or access point is within a one lane section. Temporary signals with multiple phasing must then be used. • There must be adequate visibility/sight distance as per Table 4.7 Signal Visibility Table, without the use of auxiliary heads. + NOTE • If night-time use is required, illumination must be provided such that, as a minimum, the decision points on the approach to each end of the work zone where the signal heads are located are illuminated. This may be accomplished with portable generator powered lights that must be a minimum of 9.0 metres in height from the highway surface. The illumination provided by each light source shall be a minimum of 22.000 lumens and must not produce glare to oncoming motorists • Trailers are typically positioned at intersections to emulate traffic control. • PTTS trailers must: +NOTE ⚪ Be strategically located so that they are protected from moving traffic. ⚪ Offer resistance to displacement or damage by moderate to severe weather, vehicle impact, and vandalism. ⚪ Be positioned in such a manner that the one signal head is adjacent to the highway while the other signal head is at least 0.5 metres to 1.75 metres into the approach lane. When two PTTS are used within the same work zone, the maximum spacing recommended between the devices on a two-way, one-lane operation is 400 metres. • On MTO contracts the trailers shall not be used at intersections to emulate traffic control signals. • For MTO projects, the Ministry’s regional Traffic office must approve the use of PTTS systems, and all signal timing plans on a project-by-project basis. • MTO requires an approved PHM-125 drawing for the installation of PTTS, to be completed for each stage of construction and including unique locations for: +NOTE ⚪ Trailers. ⚪ Traffic signal heads. ⚪ Stop blocks. ⚪ Placement of barrier or detection devices. PTTS may not be used if a side street or access point is within a one lane section. NOTE For MTO projects, the Ministry’s regional Traffic office must approve the use of the PTTS system and all signal timing plans on a project-by- project basis. NOTE When two PTTS are used within the same work zone, the maximum spacing recommended between the devices on a two-way, one-lane operation is 400 metres. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4186 SECTION 4 ⚪ Loop detection technology, and/or ⚪ Video detection technology. General Hardware Requirements for PTTS PTTS devices must adhere to the following general hardware requirement criteria when used on provincial highways: • Must have a mounting height capability of 5.0 metres for both primary and secondary signal heads on each trailer, measured from the highway surface to the bottom of the signal head backboard. • Both traffic signals heads must be mounted at 5.0 metres, on all MTO contracts. • The two signal heads shall be laterally separated at a minimum of 3.0 metres.

TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4188 SECTION 4 Where TTS are used, the following guidelines and specifications apply:

    • Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) pedestrian
    

facilities should be maintained during construction. • TTS installations require approval of the appropriate road authority. • Design standards/specifications are the same as those that apply to permanent traffic signals as identified in OTM Book 12. + NOTE PTTS devices must adhere to the following green, yellow and red clearance interval requirements: Green Clearance Interval Requirements • The maximum and minimum green time must be user selectable. • All timing intervals are capable of being set in increments of one second. • For actuated time operations: ⚪ Vehicle extension time can be set in the signal controller. ⚪ If the detectors fail, the system places a constant call to the controller to ensure that it reaches the maximum green time for every cycle. Yellow Clearance Interval Requirements • Yellow clearance interval must be user selectable and consistent with OTM Books 7 and 12. Red Clearance Interval Requirements • Red clearance interval must be user selectable and consistent with OTM Books 7 and 12. • The controller must be capable of providing a variable all red clearance interval between 0 - 600 seconds. Refer to the two decision matrices in Section 4.4.6, Table 4.10 and Table 4.11, to determine if the use of PTTS is appropriate for the temporary condition.

    4.4.3.4 Temporary Traffic Signals (TTS)
    

    Temporary Traffic Signals (TTS) are normally comprised of traffic signal heads on span wires and
    

temporary wood poles. They are intended to be used as an alternative to permanent traffic signals for limited periods prior to or during the re-construction of highways and have a constant power supply and more closely resembles a normal signal installation. TTS must be used instead of PTTS at entrances, truck access routes, pedestrian crossings, or other fixed locations where required to temporarily replace existing signals. TTS must be used if time of

    day functions are required due to known variances in traffic patterns (i.e., different maximum green
    

    due to long weekend traffic patterns).
    

TTS installations require road authority approval. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 189 SECTION 4 • Operational and timing requirements are the same as those for permanent signals. • Adjustments to the signal timing may not be made unless pre-approved by the road authority. • For use on Provincial Highways a PHM-125 drawing must be prepared and approved by

    the regional Traffic office prior to installation and activation as per HTA Section 144(31).
    

Installations must comply with all regulations that pertain to traffic signals identified in HTA Regulation 626. • A standard conflict monitor must be used to verify the operation of the Master and Local trailers. The conflict monitor must be capable of monitoring the Master and Local: ⚪ Absence of signal display. ⚪ Conflicting display on the same signal head or heads. ⚪ Conflicting displays on opposing heads. • Temporary illumination using a standard design is required for all TTS installations Signal Timing Calculations for PTTS or TTS

    Book 12 (Traffic Signals) for more detailed information.
    

Figure 4.10 Signal Timing Calculations Examples

    Given:
    

    Heaviest approach volume (one-way) = 520 veh/h
    

Length of single lane section = 150 m Operating speed = 40 km/h

    Find: Length of green interval (one direction), Length of all-red interval
    

    Solution:
    

By applying the given figures to Table 4.8, we find that:

    a) Cycle length = 90 seconds
    

    b) All-red interval = 14 seconds
    

    The amber clearance from OTM Book 12 (Traffic Signals) formula calculated using
    

a 1.8 second perception-reaction time is 3.6 seconds at 40 km/h. Round this value up to 4 seconds if the PTTS is unable to provide tenths of a second for the amber interval. Since the green time for each approach is equal to the cycle length, minus two

    all-red intervals (28 seconds), minus two amber intervals (8 seconds if minimum)
    

divided by two, then the:

    Green Time (for each approach) = (90 - (2 x 14) - (2 x 4))/2 = 27 seconds

Not all single lane construction zones will have a speed of 40 km/h. The following describes how the timing of portable traffic signals at signalized single lane construction zones may be calculated for speeds other than 40 km/h.

    Given: Heaviest approach volume (one-way) = Service Volume (vehicles per hour) = SV,Length of single lane = L
    

    Find: Length of green and amber intervals (one direction), Length of all-red interval
    

    Solution:
    

3.  Calculate the all-red interval, AR seconds

    AR(s) = Length of Single Lane (m) / Operating Speed (m/s)
    

    = 3.6 x Length of Single Lane (m) / Operating Speed (km/h)
    

4.  Choose a desired cycle length, C seconds (ranging from 40 to 150

    seconds)
    

5.  Calculate the average vehicle arrival rate, VAR

    VAR = SV x C / 3,600
    

Where VAR = average vehicle arrival rate obtained from Table 4.9

    Vehicle Arrival Rates and Green plus Amber Times (Level of Service
    

    “E”) which shows the vehicle arrival rates for rural and urban
    

    conditions, for Level of Service (LOS) “E”.
    

6.  Calculate green + amber time for each approach, (G + A) seconds, from Table 4.9 for rural or urban conditions.

    (G + A) (both approaches) = C – AR – AR
    

    (G + A) (one approach) = (C – AR – AR) / 2
    

7.  Green Time (G) = (G + A) – A (seconds) Example

    Given:
    

Heaviest approach volume = 365 veh/h Length of single lane section = 150 m Operating speed = 25 km/h

    Amber = 3 s
    

    Find: Length of green and amber intervals (one direction), Length of all-red interval
    

    Solution:
    

1.  AR = (3.6 x 150) / 25 = 21.6 s
2.  Choose cycle length of 90 seconds
3.  AR = (365 x 90) / 3,600 = 9.1 passenger cars per cycle per lane
4.  (G + A) from Table 4.9 for rural conditions = 23 seconds
5.  Green time (G) = 23 – 3 = 20 seconds BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 191 SECTION 4

    • A rolling closure consists of pace vehicles used to hold back (restrain)
    

all upstream traffic at a lower pace to create a gap in traffic of up to

    15 minutes to complete an Intermittent operation (i.e. change traffic
    

    control, overhead sign install, debris removal).
    

• Road authority approval is required to operate pilot or pace vehicles except when pace vehicles are used to provide a short-term rolling closure for the set up or removal of traffic control devices. • Where practicable the use of pilot or pace vehicles should be decided by the road authority prior to contract tendering. The road authority must also make the decision whether to use: +NOTE • Police vehicles. Driver compliance is likely to be higher when paced by a police vehicle rather than a contractor vehicle. • Road authority staff and their vehicles. • Contractor staff and their vehicles. • A combination of the above. Each truck or bus is equivalent to 2 passenger cars. NOTE Road authority approval is required to operate pilot or pace vehicles except when pace vehicles are used to provide a short- term rolling closure for the set up or removal of traffic control devices. NOTE It is the road authority’s decision whether to use the police, its own staff, and/or contractors to act as pilot or pace vehicles. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4194 SECTION 4 If forces other than the police are used for traffic control with moving vehicles, adequate training should be provided to the staff who will operate these vehicles. 4.4.4.1 Pilot Vehicles Pilot Vehicles are used on a two-lane highway to guide a platoon of vehicles, at an appropriate speed, through a one-lane section of a complex temporary traffic control zone or detour. Where pilot vehicles are used for traffic control, the following guidelines and specifications apply: • The operation of pilot vehicles must include traffic controls at each end of the one-lane section, such as TCP, and one or two vehicles with communication links between them all. • The pilot vehicle moves into the position at the head of the queue of vehicles about to be released by the TCP. • When directed by the TCP, the pilot vehicle guides the vehicles through the work zone

    (Direction 1).
    

• At the far end of the one-lane section, beyond the work zone, the pilot vehicle pulls over at the earliest safe opportunity and signals the following queue to pass. • When the last vehicle of the queue clears the one-lane work zone section, the pilot vehicle

    in the other direction (Direction 2) should follow the same procedure as outlined above.
    

Preferably, two pilot vehicles are used for this operation, one in each direction, to reduce motorist delay and driver frustration. • Alternatively, if traffic volumes are low, the pilot vehicle in Direction 2 may be the same

    pilot vehicle as in Direction 1 (which turns around at the end of the work zone and takes its
    

    position at the head of the queue).
    

• The pilot vehicle should display the name of the contractor or road authority. The TC-27 DO NOT PASS WHEN FLASHING sign must be mounted in a conspicuous location on the rear of the vehicle. • Where significant queuing occurs or is expected to occur, or visibility at the end of the queue is insufficient, the TC-20 or TC-20A PREPARE TO STOP sign should be used upstream of the expected end of the queue. • Two or more pilot vehicles may be used to guide two-way traffic through a particularly complex detour. • Work vehicles that enter the work zone should be managed by the TCP so that they are the

    last vehicle(s) in the queue, to avoid other vehicles following them into the work area.
    

BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 195 SECTION 4 4.4.4.2 Pace Vehicles Pace vehicles are used to control the speed of vehicles through a work zone where speed control is required but is difficult to achieve by other means. Where pace vehicles are used for traffic control, the following guidelines and specifications apply: • The deployment of pace vehicles is not simple or straightforward. Extra care must be taken to ensure that the use of pace vehicles is done safely. • Where significant queuing and congestion are expected, or where pace vehicles must be deployed in low volume situations with vehicles approaching at high speed, advance signing should be provided to warn of possible stops or the use of pace vehicles. • Caution and experience are necessary to effectively and safely apply pace vehicles in low volume, high speed traffic situations. • The TC-27 DO NOT PASS WHEN FLASHING sign must be mounted in a conspicuous location on the rear of each non-police pace vehicle.

    • Pace vehicle(s) must lead at a reasonable speed. The speed differential
    

between vehicles that are approaching the work zone from upstream to the last vehicles in the queue must not create a collision hazard. A realistic speed reduction is 10 to 15 km/h below the NPRS.+NOTE • Good communication among pace vehicles is essential for good traffic control. • Pace vehicles should only be used where there is a single lane through the work zone. One or more vehicles may be necessary to pace traffic through one or more lane closures to reach the single lane section.

    • The pace vehicle(s) (one per lane) will enter the free-flowing traffic upstream of the first
    

lane closure and downstream of any on ramps. The vehicles will gradually reduce speed and align with each other to prevent drivers from changing lanes to get in front of the pace vehicles. • At the end of the taper, the pace vehicle in the closed lane should merge into the traffic behind the pace vehicle in the remaining open lane. Determining the Number of Pace Vehicles Required A sufficient number of pace vehicles are required to provide continuous speed reduction to avoid end of queue collisions within a work zone.

    When the last vehicle in a queue has entered the work zone, pace vehicle(s) must be in place to
    

lead and pace the next vehicles through the work zone. This means that the time to traverse the work zone, plus the time required to circle back and take position back in the traffic stream, must be considered. Pace vehicles should only be used where there is a single lane through the work zone. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4196 SECTION 4

    The number of pace vehicles (PV) required can be calculated as follows:
    

    PV = N x (Cycle Time / Work Zone Traversal Time)
    

    where:
    

    PV = the number of pace vehicles needed
    

    N = the number of lanes in the direction of interest in advance of any lane closures
    

    (assuming that only one lane is left open to traffic in the work zone).
    

\Work zone traversal time is the time required to drive through the work zone at the pace vehicle speed. Cycle time is the time required for a given pace vehicle to drive through the work zone, plus the time required to circle back to start another run through the work zone. The cycle time will be

    affected by traffic volume, and characteristics of the highway network; i.e., how directly and quickly a
    

pace vehicle can drive around and return to the beginning of the work zone. For example, consider an operation with three lanes that are being progressively closed to one, with a work zone traversal time of 10 minutes, and a return time of 20 minutes from the end of the work zone back to the beginning. To avoid the risk of fast vehicles closing in on slow vehicles in the work zone, a new set of three pace vehicles will be required every 10 minutes.

    N = 3 lanes
    

Work Zone Traversal Time = 10 mins

    Cycle time = 10 mins (Work Zone Traversal Time) + 20 mins (return time)
    

\= 30 mins

    PV = 3 lanes x (30 mins/10 mins)
    

\= 9 pace vehicles. Determining the Number of Pace Vehicle Hours Required Since the purpose of pace vehicles is to control traffic speed, they are not required during periods when traffic congestion alone results in traffic speeds at or below the desired speed. However, continuous observation of traffic conditions must be maintained so that they can be promptly re-introduced into the traffic stream when congestion eases and speeds increase. +NOTE To estimate the number of pace vehicle hours required over the duration of a

    contract:
    

1.  Determine the number of pace vehicles needed (explained above).
2.  Calculate the number of hours that the pace vehicles are required as the total hours that a reduced speed is desired, minus the hours during which congestion alone results in speeds of 15 km/h or more below the NPRS.
3.  Pace vehicle hours = number of pace vehicles x hours
4.  If there are multiple stages within a contract, the number of pace vehicles required will need to be calculated for each unique configuration. The total pace vehicle hours required Pace vehicles are not required during periods when traffic congestion alone results in speeds below the desired speed. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 197 SECTION 4 for the contract will be the sum of individually calculated pace vehicle hours for each configuration. 4.4.4.3 Rolling Closures

    Contractor vehicles may be used as pace vehicles in a rolling closure; however, driver compliance is
    

likely to be higher when controlled by a police vehicle.

    Police vehicles are recommended on high-volume highways (required on provincial freeways).
    

    • The DO NOT PASS WHEN FLASHING sign (TC-27) must be mounted in a conspicuous
    

location on the rear of all non-police pace vehicles used in a rolling closure. Prevention of traffic moving past the rolling closure is critical to ensure worker safety. Communication between pace vehicles and downstream workers must be in place to alert workers if the closure has been breached. One of the following two approaches should be used for rolling closures:

1.  Urban freeways with frequent interchanges. Drivers are generally accustomed to frequent congestion on urban high-volume freeways and it is neither desirable nor possible to prevent vehicles from entering the highway at all upstream entrance ramps. +NOTE • The rolling closure operation is initiated by lead pace vehicles travelling abreast, one vehicle per lane, several kilometers upstream of the closure site to control the flow and speed of traffic that is approaching the closure site. • As the pace vehicles approach the site, they gradually reduce their

    speed allowing traffic ahead (downstream) of them to clear the work zone at a normal
    

speed. • After the pace vehicles pass the entrance ramps of the last upstream interchange, they continue to reduce their speed, coming to a complete halt, if necessary, just upstream of the closure site to create the necessary time window. ⚪ The slowing and stopping of the pace vehicles should be progressive and gradual so that drivers have time to adjust to the situation, as in a similar congestion situation. • When the work at the closure site is complete, pace vehicles turn off their flashing lights and allow traffic to resume normal flow. Rural freeways with infrequent interchanges Drivers expect free flow conditions on rural low volume freeways. A sudden requirement to come to

    a halt would violate driver expectation and present a hazard. Therefore, the pace vehicle(s) should
    

Prevention of traffic moving past the rolling closure is critical to ensure worker safety. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4198 SECTION 4 lead at a planned speed reduction of no more than 15-20 km/h below the NPRS and the use of

    advance warning signs, such as the PREPARE TO STOP sign (TC-20), should be considered.
    

The distance upstream of the work zone where the rolling closure operation will be initiated must be calculated. The point of initiation must be further upstream than the distance travelled by the pace vehicles, at the planned speed, in the total time required to:

    a) Clear the last unrestrained vehicle from the work zone.
    

    b) Perform the work.
    

    c) Clear workers from the roadway.
    

This distance may be as great as 15 km to 25 km. This means that a rolling closure is unlikely to be suitable in all situations but must be carefully tailored to the road configuration and network involved. • The rolling closure operation is initiated by lead pace vehicles travelling abreast, one vehicle per lane, to control the flow and speed of traffic that is approaching the closure site. • As the pace vehicles approach the site, they gradually reduce their speed, allowing traffic

    ahead (downstream) of them to clear the work zone at a normal speed.
    

• As the rolling closure is approaching the work zone, all entrance ramps at the intermediate interchanges must be closed until the rolling closure has passed to prevent vehicles from entering the clear zone ahead of the lead pace vehicles. • If the rolling closure starts more than one interchange back, it may be desirable for the lead pace vehicles to drive at a speed closer to the normal posted speed until they have passed the last interchange, and then decelerate to a lower speed when it is no longer possible for entrance ramp traffic to pass them or enter ahead of them. • All work vehicles involved in the rolling closure, including lead pace vehicles, vehicles at intermediate interchange entrance ramps, and at the work area itself, be in good communication with each other to alert workers if the closure has been breached. +NOTE • When the work operation is complete, the lead pace vehicles may speed up, at or beyond the work zone, and merge into one lane, permitting other traffic to pass them. • If the work operation includes the set-up of a lane closure, the lead pace vehicle in the closed lane should merge behind the lead pace vehicle in the open lane at the end of the taper. • In some circumstances, it may be necessary or desirable to bring vehicles to a very low speed or even to a stopped position. This need may arise if operations at the work area run into unexpected difficulties and require more time. Where very low speeds or stops are planned or can be reasonably anticipated to be required, advance signage such as

    the PREPARE TO STOP sign (TC-20), should be used.
    

On rural low volume freeways, the pace vehicle should lead at a speed no less than 15-20 km/h below the NPRS. NOTE All work vehicles involved in the rolling closure should be in good communication to alert workers if the closure has been breached. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 199 SECTION 4 4.4.5 Paid Duty Police Officers When paid duty police officers are present, driver compliance with traffic control devices is likely to be higher and observed speed lower. The use of paid duty police officers may be specified in a Traffic Control Plan to provide the following tasks: • Enforcement – layout of a temporary configuration often presents challenges to effective enforcement. The road authority, contractor, and police should discuss expectations and procedures prior to beginning the work. • Authority – where enforcement is not practicable, the presence alone of paid duty officers and an enforcement vehicle in the work zone have proven to be effective measures to help manage speed and increase compliance with traffic control measures. The location and schedule should be determined in advance. The effectiveness should be monitored and modified if issues are identified. +NOTE Traffic direction at intersections - Paid duty officers must be used to control traffic within 30 metres of an intersection with operating signals. If traffic does not need to be controlled at the intersection, however, paid duty officers are not required. Traffic control with moving vehicles – the road authority may specify the use of paid duty officers and police vehicles to be used for pace or pilot vehicles, or conduct rolling closures. Where paid duty police officers are used, the following guidelines and specifications apply: • Early and ongoing communication between the road authority, workers, and paid duty police officers is important for the effective planning and coordination of traffic control procedures. • Before work begins, paid duty officers should be provided with information on their roles and responsibilities as well as those of the road authority and workers in the work zone. ⚪ This exchange can be carried out during a pre-construction meeting between the paid duty officer and the road authority. The pre-construction meeting should identify the best approach for enforcement. +NOTE • A safe location to carry out enforcement should be identified. In a stationary work zone, where practicable, paid duty officers should be located on the shoulder, before the taper begins. • The paid duty officer should be provided with a point of contact in the field to notify of any deficiencies, potential problems, or hazardous conditions observed. Before work begins, paid duty officers should be provided with information on their roles and responsibilities as well as those of the road authority and workers in the work zone. NOTE Paid duty officers must be used to control traffic within 30 metres of an intersection with operating traffic control signals. See Section 4.4.2 on TCP. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4200 SECTION 4 • When deployed in a temporary work zone, paid duty officers should: ⚪ Review the Traffic Control Plan to identify possible issues that may impede their operation. ⚪ Drive through the work zone from both directions and note all entranceways. This will help the officer become familiar with the work zone. ⚪ Maintain visibility by turning on the emergency lights in place of headlights on their vehicles and wearing a retroreflective safety vest while outside of the vehicle. ⚪ Observe traffic conditions at all times while in the work zone. • Training of paid duty police officers in the application of OTM Book 7 is recommended to improve their knowledge of traffic control in temporary work zones. • Paid duty officers must comply with Ministry of Labour, Trades and Skills Development

    (MLTSD) requirements to wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
    

Refer to the two decision matrices in Section 4.4.6, Table 4.10 and Table 4.11, to determine if the use of paid duty police officers is appropriate for the temporary condition. 4.4.6 Decision Matrices for the Use of Devices to Regulate and Control the Flow of Traffic Table 4.10 and Table 4.11 are decision matrices that clearly define the usage criteria for TCP and other traffic control devices.

BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 205 SECTION 4 4.5 Positive Protection Devices Proper use of guidance/information devices and flow control devices provide for the safe and efficient movement of traffic through a work zone. In addition, some temporary conditions may warrant the use of positive protection devices to prevent the intrusion of motorized vehicles into the workspace and other hazardous areas of the work zone. The following sections provide a description of positive protection devices, including their general applications and limitations, MTO specifications, and guidelines.

    4.5.1 Buffer Vehicle (BV)
    

    A Buffer Vehicle (BV) is a truck placed upstream of a work area to provide
    

protection for workers against an out of control vehicle approaching a work area. • The BV should be unoccupied for stationary operations and may

    be equipped with a Truck or Trailer Mounted Attenuator (TMA).
    

    • A BV without a TMA is defined as a Blocker Truck (BT).
    

    • A BV with a TMA is defined as a Crash Truck (CT).
    

• A CT is preferred over a BT as the TMA reduces the risk of injury to the occupants of the incoming vehicle and to the CT driver. • A BV requires a mounted TC-12 FLASHING ARROW BOARD and four- way flashers. +NOTE For stationary operations, BV are typically used in combination with Longitudinal

    Buffer Areas (LBA).
    

• If a BV is used on a non-freeway, the appropriate LBA is required for stationary operations.

    • On multi-lane highways with Normal Posted Regulatory Speed (NPRS) of 70 km/h or
    

higher, a CT is recommended over a BT.

    4.5.1.1 Truck Mounted Attenuator (TMA) and Buffer Vehicle (BV)
    

Requirements

    Truck Mounted Attenuator (TMA) Requirements
    

An attenuator is an energy-absorbing device mounted onto the rear of a truck or trailer, which will deform upon impact in a controlled manner, thereby reducing the rate of: A Crash Truck is preferred over a blocker truck as the truck mounted attenuator reduces the risk of injury. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4206 SECTION 4

    • Deceleration (and associated injury) for the occupants of a vehicle which has struck the
    

TMA from the rear.

    • Acceleration (and associated injury) for the driver of the truck.
    

TMA, whether truck or trailer mounted, should be selected for the appropriate posted speed as noted

    below:
    

    • All TMA used on freeways must satisfy the level TL-3 requirement (100 km/h). The
    

100 km/h reference relates to the testing speed, not the posted speed of the facility on which it is required for use. • TMA must meet the requirements of AASHTO Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware

    (MASH) TL-3 or National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) 350 Level TL-2
    

    (70 km/h) or higher.
    

    • All new TMA (replacements and new purchases) must be up to date to meet the MASH
    

requirements.

    Buffer Vehicle (BV) Requirements
    

BV Weight: CT used on MTO contracts must have:

    • Minimum mass of 6,800 kg (15,000 pounds), excluding attachments or ballast.
    

    • Maximum mass of 12,000 kg (26,400 pounds), including any ballast, flashing arrow
    

boards, or TMA. Trucks heavier than 12,000 kg may be used if the road authority considers acceleration/deceleration characteristics to be adequate or not an issue. BV Ballast: • If loose material, such as sand, is used as ballast, it must be kept below the level of the sides of the BV box. • If solid objects, such as concrete blocks, are used, they must be attached to the truck body in such a manner as to withstand a major impact without breaking free of their attachments. BV Brakes: • BV brakes must be mechanically fitted and properly adjusted. • A BV with tandem rear axles must have both axles braked when parked in a stationary operation or must be able to raise the unbraked rear axle. • Air brakes are preferred over hydraulic brakes on a BV.

    • Users should ensure that at least two-thirds of the BV mass is over the rear axle(s).
    

BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 207 SECTION 4 BV used on Provincial highways must have: • A mounted 1.2 metre x 2.1 metre TC-12 FLASHING ARROW BOARD with in-cab remote controls. • A high back seat and head rest for the operator. • A competent, trained operator. • An audio alert which automatically activates when backing up. For both stationary work areas and mobile work operations, no passengers are allowed in the BV when it is used in traffic control situations, except for special reasons +NOTE Where BV are used to protect stationary work operations, the driver/operator of the BV must ensure that the BV is positioned in accordance with the layout figures in Book 7 and proceed as follows:

1.  Ensure that the TC-12 FLASHING ARROW BOARD is operating.
2.  Lock the brakes and angle the wheels slightly away from the work area and live traffic.
3.  Leave the BV for the duration of the work operation. 4.5.1.2 Placement of Buffer Vehicles Using Longitudinal and Lateral Intrusions To mitigate risk of injury to highway users and workers, two types of out of control vehicular behaviour need to be considered in the placement of BV:
4.  Longitudinal intrusions.
5.  Lateral intrusions into a work area. These are further described below. Longitudinal Intrusions A longitudinal intrusion occurs when a vehicle enters a closed lane upstream of a stationary work area through the taper. The length of the lane closure taper plus the LBA upstream of the BV should provide the driver with sufficient braking distance, as illustrated in Figure 4.11 Buffer Vehicles and LBA Scenarios.+NOTE In stationary work operations the following longitudinal intrusions could occur. For stationary work areas and mobile work operations, no passengers are allowed in the BV when it is used in traffic control situations. NOTE The length of the lane closure taper plus the LBA upstream of the BV should provide the driver with sufficient braking distance. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4208 SECTION 4 Example 1: • The incoming vehicle entering the lane closure taper longitudinally upstream of the work area begins braking in the taper, after running over the barrels or cones at the start of the taper, and comes to a stop within the taper itself. Example 2: • The incoming vehicle entering the lane closure taper longitudinally upstream of the work area does not begin braking until the end of the taper. • In this example, the LBA should provide sufficient additional braking distance for the vehicle to come to a halt before the end of the LBA. Example 3: • If the driver has still not come to a complete stop by the end of the LBA, the BV provides a third line of defence for workers. A BV should not be placed at the end of the taper. If an out of control vehicle does not have sufficient distance to slow down prior to impact, a long BV roll- ahead distance may occur resulting in vehicle damage and personal injury. +NOTE Provided the LBA is installed upstream of the BV, the expected BV roll-ahead distance is

    accommodated within the Lateral Intrusion Deterrence Gap (LIDG). (See Lateral Intrusions below.)
    

LBA and LIDG for various speeds are given in Table A, Table B, and Table C found in Section 6. In mobile work operations, stationary LBA cannot be used. See Section 3.5.1 for measures for mobile operations. Lateral Intrusions A lateral intrusion occurs when a vehicle, in a live lane adjacent to the work area, laterally intrudes into the gap in the closed lane between the BV and the work area.

    In stationary and mobile work operations, the appropriate distance to use in front (downstream) of the
    

    BV is called the Lateral Intrusion Deterrence Gap (LIDG).
    

The use of LIDG in stationary work operations on freeways and non-freeways in combination with the taper, LBA, and BV, is illustrated in Figure 4.11 Buffer Vehicles and LBA Scenarios. To mitigate the risk of lateral intrusions into stationary work operations: A BV should not be placed at the end of the taper. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 209 SECTION 4

    • The BV is positioned about 2.5 seconds in travel time upstream of workers. (It takes the
    

    driver of a vehicle about 2.5 seconds to perceive and react to the gap in front of a BV).
    

    Example:
    

• A vehicle travelling at 100 km/h covers 70 metres in 2.5 seconds. • If a BV is positioned 70 metres upstream of the work area, the driver of the vehicle will likely pass by the work area in front of the BV before a decision can be made to turn into the gap. LIDG for various NPRS are chosen from Table A, Table B, and Table C found in Section 6. The use of LIDG in mobile work operations on freeways and non-freeways in combination with a BV, is illustrated in Figure 4.11 Buffer Vehicles and LBA Scenarios. To mitigate the risk of lateral intrusions into mobile work operations: • The BV shadows the work vehicle as it moves along the highway at a distance upstream that is equivalent to about 2.5 seconds in relative travel time between the highway user speed and the moving work vehicle.

    Example:
    

• The driver of an errant vehicle will take about 2.5 seconds to perceive and react to the gap in front of a moving BV. • A vehicle that is travelling at 100 km/h covers 70 metres in 2.5 seconds. • A BV that is shadowing a moving work operation typically travels at 20 km/h. • In 2.5 seconds, the BV would cover 14 metres at 20 km/h.

    • If a BV is positioned about 56 metres (i.e., 70 metres minus 14 metres) upstream of the
    

work area, the driver of the vehicle will likely pass by the moving work vehicle in front of the BV before a decision can be made to turn into the gap The appropriate distance to use in front of BV that are shadowing moving work vehicles is the LIDG. LIDG for various NPRS are chosen from Table A, Table B, and Table C found in Section 6. The appropriate distance to use in front of BV that are shadowing moving work vehicles is the LIDG.

Especially during situations with limited visibility, such as storm events and nighttime, appropriate vehicle lightings help to mitigate traffic hazards to workers and drivers on public highways. Vehicles that require lightings to function as a traffic control device are typically equipped

    with either four-way flashers (4WF) plus 360-degree beacon, rotating LED amber lights, or TC-12.
    

A 360-degree beacon is a device with an amber light source that continually shows the light source through all 360 degrees of the compass, completing a full rotation every 1.5 seconds. If a 360-degree beacon is used, the four-way flashers are not required to be operated continuously for longer duration work. Alternatively, rotating LED amber lights can be used in place of 4WF plus 360-degree beacon.

    The rotating LED amber lights must be positioned as a pair; one on the left and the other on the
    

right, mounted and installed at a height so visible from 360 degrees around. Listed below are the specifications required of rotating LED amber lights:

    a) SAE J845 Compliant. SAE J845 provides design guidelines, test procedure references,
    

and performance requirements of optical warning devices for authorized emergency, maintenance, and service vehicles.

    b) Cover can be either amber or clear.
    

    c) Rotational light pattern in 0.8 to 1.2 Hz range (no strobes or flashes) and both lights
    

shall be in sync with each other having the Identical pattern.

    d) Full 360-degree LED light output and must not be able to do any other pattern.
    

    e) Output of 2500-3000 lumens in non-dimmed state
    

    f) Auto-dim at night or have switch in cab to enable dim function
    

    g) “ON/OFF” switch in cab shall be lighted when Rotating LED Amber Lights are in
    

operation 4.5.2 Glare Screens Glare screens are mounted on the top of barriers to minimize distraction to highway users. Their ability to discourage driver distraction and reduce headlight glare from opposing traffic may improve safety and traffic flow. Screens should not be placed where they may interfere with the safe operation of vehicles, in particular, where they may adversely affect highway user visibility and sight distance. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4212 SECTION 4 4.5.3 Barriers Barriers protect work zones and drivers by preventing or reducing penetration to the work zone, and through controlled redirection of an errant vehicle.

    When a temporary construction barrier system (TCBS) is specified adjacent to an excavation, a level
    

area extending at least one metre from the upper edge of each wall of an excavation shall be kept clear

    of equipment, excavated soil, rock and construction material (per Regulation 213/91, Section 233(1) of
    

    Part III under the OHSA).
    

The effectiveness of a barrier system depends on: • Correct placement. • Size, speed, and angle of the approach of an errant vehicle. Barriers are required to protect workers from traffic in an adjacent live lane under the following

    conditions (per Regulation 213/91, Section 67(1), under the OHSA):
    

• Construction projects on freeways. • Non-mobile operations. • On projects that require more than five days to complete, although there may be circumstances that suggest the use of barriers for a period of less than five days to ensure the protection and safety of highway users and workers. Where all of these conditions are present, but it is not practical to install the barriers as required, or where the project requires five days or less to complete, an LBA and a CT must be adequately positioned to protect workers who are working on a freeway. In addition, barriers may be required or used to:

    • Protect workers when completing maintenance work. (Refer to Regulation 851/90, Section
    

    20, under the OSHA).
    

• Positively separate two-way, high-speed/high-volume traffic flows. There are four types of TCBS that have been used successfully on provincial highway projects: • Temporary Concrete Barrier. • Moveable Temporary Concrete Barrier. • Temporary Steel Barrier. • Temporary Type M Steel Beam Guide Rail. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 213 SECTION 4 A description of some of the barrier systems used in Ontario work zones, guidelines, and specifications for their use are provided below. 4.5.3.1 Temporary Concrete Barriers A temporary concrete barrier is a portable barrier system consisting of freestanding precast concrete segments that are positively connected to form a continuous barrier. Where temporary concrete barriers are used, the following guidelines and specifications apply: • Temporary concrete barriers must not be placed perpendicular to the direction of travel and are not intended to be used across a highway for a highway closure. • On long-term freeway construction projects, temporary concrete barriers or other equivalent barrier systems should be installed to protect workers from vehicular traffic in accordance with Regulation 213/91, Section 67, under the OHSA. • Temporary concrete barriers may also be used to positively separate two-way, high- speed/high-volume traffic flows.

    • Temporary concrete barriers shall be according to Ontario Provincial Standard (OPS) or
    

other standard when specified by a road authority. Factors to consider include: ⚪ Temporary concrete barriers shall only be used on a solid surface, such as asphalt or concrete pavement. ⚪ Temporary concrete barriers are not to be placed such that there are hazards within the deflection area. ⚪ Temporary concrete barriers can be laterally displaced when struck. Temporary concrete barrier restraint systems or reduced deflection temporary concrete barrier systems should be used on high speed highways when temporary concrete barrier protection is required within: ⚪ 1.0 metre of an excavation.

    ⚪ 1.0 metre of structures not designed for impacts (e.g., scaffolding).
    

⚪ 1.0 metre of the edge of a bridge deck. • Lane closures are required to place a barrier. Barriers should be constructed in the downstream direction. • An offset distance of at least 0.5 metres from the edge of a lane to the barrier is desirable. • Temporary concrete barriers and energy attenuators should be offset and installed according to OPS or as specified by the road authority. • Temporary concrete barriers can impact highway drainage. Winter sand and other debris can block drainage openings under the temporary concrete barrier. Temporary concrete TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4214 SECTION 4 barrier drainage gaps should only be used when justified based on hydraulic analysis at

    key drainage locations (sumps, catch basins, etc.).
    

• Although barrier walls may serve the additional function of channelizing traffic, their use should be determined by the protective requirements of the location rather than the channelizing needs. • The angle of barrier installation is to deflect an errant vehicle, and not to be confused with the taper length and angle specified in Table A, Table B, or Table C found in Section 6 that are used for channelization. • If a protective barrier also functions as the means for channelization, the devices must be used with temporary pavement edge lines as well as reflective delineation. • Taper lengths must comply with the minimum desirable taper length for various approach speeds as provided in Table A, Table B, or Table C found in Section 6. Where minimum taper lengths are not practicable within the proper design of the barrier, the required taper must be delineated with TC-54. 4.5.3.2 Moveable Temporary Concrete Barriers A moveable barrier consists of one metre long sections of linked barriers that can be mechanically shifted laterally, through the use of a special purpose vehicle. A moveable barrier is typically used: • To provide a reversible lane. +OTE • When the risk associated with frequent lane closures required to accommodate construction staging warrants the expense of a moveable barrier. The application of moveable barriers must be approved by the road authority.

    4.5.3.3 Temporary Steel Barriers (TSB)
    

TSB are portable barrier systems consisting of free-standing fabricated double-sided steel barrier segments that are positively connected together to form a continuous barrier system. TSB system can be configured to minimize deflection using additional steel anchors at specified intervals. TSB include the following systems: • BarrierGuard 800 consists of galvanized steel segments meeting the NCHRP Report 350 TL-3. Adjacent segments are connected using connectors that lock into place. • ZoneGuard meets MASH TL-3. Adjacent segments are connected into place at the top of the barrier. • The Defender meets MASH TL-3. Adjacent segments are connected using sliding interlocking connectors and a joining pin. The application of moveable barriers must be approved by the road authority. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 215 SECTION 4 Ballast filled barriers must only be used in urban areas of low speed and for vehicles that weigh 1,800 kg or less. NOTE • The Safezone system meets MASH TL-3. Adjacent segments are connected using connectors that lock into place and are secured with a bolt. • The HV2 system meets MASH TL-4 and does not require anchoring. Adjacent segments are connected using an interlocking joiner.

    4.5.3.4 Temporary Type M Steel Beam Guide Rail (Type M SBGR)
    

Temporary Type M SBGR systems are used for temporary installations on granular roadway surfaces to provide positive protection between traffic and the work area and workers. 4.5.4 Ballast Filled Barriers Ballast filled barriers are longitudinal barriers of segmented polyethylene plastic shells with a steel framework, which are designed for use with ballast of water or sand. Ballast filled barriers should only be used when approved by the highway authority.+NOTE Where ballast filled barriers are used, the following guidelines and specifications

    apply:
    

• Ballast filled barriers are relatively easy to install, given their initial low weight in comparison to other longitudinal barriers. ⚪ Empty sections of a barrier may be placed by hand in areas that may have otherwise become restrictive for the use of heavy lifting equipment.+NOTE ⚪ Steel rails are then placed on the barriers to redirect potentially impacted vehicles, and water or sand is used as the ballast to secure the barrier. The purpose of steel rails is to completely avoid vehicle penetration through ballast filled barriers. ⚪ Barriers must be filled in accordance with manufacture’s specifications to be effective. • When ballast filled barriers are impacted, the deflection may be as great as 2.0 metres to 8.0 metres. ⚪ The deflection is greater for ballast filled than concrete barriers, mainly due to the lighter weight of ballast versus concrete. ⚪ For this reason, ballast filled barriers should only be used in urban areas of low speed and for vehicles that weigh 1,800 kilograms or less. When used for channelizing in a transition taper, devices should provide a smooth and gradual transition. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4216 SECTION 4 • In cold weather, sodium chloride or an environmentally friendly antifreeze should be used to prevent freezing of the ballast water inside the barrier. • Care must be taken upon impact, as the ballast water could pose a potential hazard if the water forms into ice on the surface. +NOTE • Environmental regulations and guidelines must be followed for the proper removal and drainage of ballast filled barriers. The disposing of the ballast water when the barrier is removed may require the water to be pumped and transported offsite. 4.5.5 Energy Attenuators Energy attenuators on barrier ends are needed to reduce the severity of impacts. Energy attenuators shall be according to OPS or other standards as specified by the road authority. An energy attenuator is typically used: • With at least 150 mm of asphalt pavement. • With no anchor needed. • On a paved surface. Reduced exposure energy attenuators are a non-redirective, gating, crash cushion system. They meet the crash test requirements of either MASH TL-2 and TL-3 or the NCHRP Report 350 TL-2 and TL-3. These attenuator systems should be considered for shorter term temporary energy attenuator installations and not to be used during winter shutdown. They include the followings: the Absorb 350, the ABSORB-M, the SLED, and the ACZ 350. 4.5.6 Mobile Barriers Mobile Barrier systems consist of a modular unit on wheels pulled by a standard truck tractor with reversible axles which allow the unit to be reconfigured for either right or left applications. The mobile unit alleviates the need for highway crews to use a TCBS, which reduces the exposure of workers to traffic and the overall duration of work. Where mobile barriers are used, the following guidelines and specifications apply: • The mobile unit should be orange in colour to alert drivers that highway work is taking place. For use on freeways, the unit must also be equipped with an approved energy attenuator. Environmental regulations and guidelines must be followed for the proper removal and drainage of ballast filled barriers. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 217 SECTION 4 • Typical mobile units can be expanded from 13 metres to 31 metres in length and can be customized by adding:+NOTE

    ⚪ Portable Variable Message Sign (PVMS).
    

⚪ Speed detection device. ⚪ Portable generator. ⚪ Lighting. ⚪ Rear wheel steerable axle. • The determination of whether and where mobile barriers can be used in work zones is at the discretion of the road authority. • The use of mobile barriers must be approved by the road authority and all necessary permits must be obtained. 4.5.7 Vehicle Arresting Systems Vehicle arresting systems are defined as: • Portable netting, cables, and energy-absorbing anchors designed to gradually slow down errant vehicles and prevent penetration into activity areas. Vehicle arresting systems are used to prevent errant vehicles from entering the work space when sections of a highway are frequently opened and closed during extended work operations. Where vehicle arresting systems are used, the following guidelines and specifications apply: • The system is placed across the highway at the closure point, downstream ramps, and other potential entrance points. • Where provisions are necessary to allow construction traffic to bypass the system, the

    highway authority may elect to have a paid duty officer (PDO) stationed at the bypass to
    

prevent unauthorized entry into the workspace. • Application and design of vehicle arresting systems must be approved by the highway authority. 4.5.8 Temporary Transverse Rumble Strips

    Temporary Transverse Rumble Strips (TTRS) are grooved or raised corrugations that are placed on the
    

highway pavement surface perpendicular to the path of travel, such that motor vehicles passing over the corrugations simultaneously generate audible and vibratory stimuli. The determination of whether and where mobile barriers can be used is at the discretion of the road authority and all necessary permits must be obtained. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4218 SECTION 4 TTRS are used to alert motorists that they are about to enter a work zone where an unusual or unexpected highway condition exists that requires a speed reduction or stop. For additional information on managing speeds, refer to Section 3.6. Temporary rumble strips may be used when:

    • The work duration is Short Duration or Long Duration;
    

    • Traffic Control Persons are present;
    

    • Portable or Temporary Traffic Signals are used; or
    

• Drivers are inattentive. Temporary rumble strips should not be used: • On a sharp vertical curve. • On highways shared with cyclists unless there is a clear path of at least 1.2 m in each direction for cyclists to bypass the temporary rumble strips. • In locations where high volumes of motorcycles are present. • Where noise may be a concern. TTRS must not be used: • On a horizontal curve. • Within intersections. • Within pedestrian crossings. Where TTRS are used, the following guidelines and specifications apply: • Application and design of TTRS must be approved by the road authority. • Strips can be glued, screwed or nailed onto the highway surface or can remain in place by weight and friction. • Strips are typically used in sets of two or three. • Located at least at the minimum stopping sight distance in advance of the unusual or unexpected highway condition. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 219 SECTION 4 4.6 Monitoring of Contractor Compliance The principal responsibility for ensuring that traffic control equipment, materials, and protective devices are maintained in good condition rests with the contractor. Monitoring of contractor compliance by the road authority is also important for quality guidelines to be effective. Quality may decline if monitoring of compliance is not effectively and consistently done. +NOTE 4.7 Application of New Technologies New technologies and techniques continue to be developed for application in work zones. As new technologies and techniques are tested in real-life situations, it is important that they be accepted into standard practice and guidelines through an orderly, controlled process. For this purpose, a public-private partnership was developed by the Ontario

    Good Roads Association (OGRA) and The Road Authority (TRA). TRA is a web-
    

based database application that provides an information resource on roadway products, services, and technologies used in public works infrastructure, with the municipal and provincial governments. +NOTE There are two types of evaluations that can be documented on the TRA website:

1.  Pre-qualification of a product or vendor for the Designated Sources for

    Materials (DSM) list.
    

2.  Product classification through The Ontario Provincial Standards (OPS) Products

    Management Committee (PMC), which is responsible for the evaluation of products and
    

technologies against applicable standards and specifications. Further information on the processes for these two scenarios is available from the TRA website and are further described below. Vendors are encouraged to register their product on TRA for the benefit of all highway authorities.

    Designated Sources for Materials (DSM)
    

    The Designated Sources for Materials (DSM) is the Ministry of Transportation’s (MTO’s) official list
    

of pre-qualified products and vendors for use on provincial highway construction and maintenance The principal responsibility for ensuring that traffic control equipment, materials, and protective devices are maintained in good condition rests with the contractor. NOTE Initially, new technologies may be accepted only as supplements to existing prescribed traffic control devices. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 20222SECTION 4220 SECTION 4 contracts. The DSM acceptance criteria for the product listing may include, but is not limited to:+NOTE • Testing in the laboratory. • Evaluation of a product under field conditions. • Inspection of the manufacturer’s facilities. The DSM listing indicates that the listed manufacturer/distributor is capable of producing a product that meets MTO requirements or has demonstrated the ability to meet them in the past. Products accepted for use on the DSM must meet the general criteria outlined in DSM 100 - General Requirements for Listing Vendors and Products which can be found on the TRA website. Product Classification The OPS PMC is responsible for the evaluation of products and technologies against applicable standards and specifications. TRA publishes the decisions made by the committee. Products that are designated as, “Accepted for Use” have:

1.  Been reviewed by the committee.
2.  Met the established criteria.
3.  Been recommended as acceptable products for use in Ontario. Large municipal governments may consider placing these products on their lists of acceptable products, while smaller municipalities may solely rely on the lists published by the MTO, other

    municipalities, or TRA (The Road Authority, 2019).
    

Products that are classified as “Under Evaluation”, are undergoing lab testing and field trials and have

    not been evaluated yet as an accepted product for use (The Road Authority, 2019).
    

In addition, road authorities may conduct field evaluations of new devices or layouts. Initially, new technologies may be accepted only as supplements to existing prescribed traffic control devices, not as replacements for them. However, as experience and satisfaction are gained with the new technologies, some of them may be accepted as part of the family of prescribed traffic control devices, while others may continue to be accepted, but only as supplemental devices. Their mandatory use is at the discretion of TRA. An assessment of the need and evaluation of effectiveness should be conducted and documented where a road authority is considering: • The trial of a new device. Vendors are encouraged to register their product on TRA for the benefit of all road authorities. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 4 221 SECTION 4 • A change to an existing device. • The application of an existing device outside general policy or practice. For trials on provincial highways, approval is required from the regional Traffic office, and the provincial Traffic office should be consulted on the proposed process and provided with the results of the assessment for potential policy development. To conduct a field evaluation of a new technology, the following information should be documented in a proposal: • Detailed description and drawings of the traffic control device/application being proposed. • Description of the problem that the proposal seeks to overcome. • Location of the proposed trial and why this site is suitable. • Time frame involved. • How the non-standard treatment, or new technology can address the problem better than existing practices. • Outcomes of any previous trials or investigations. • Jurisdictional scan of relevant legislation, policies, and/or guidelines. • Assessment of any new safety issues, or other problems that may result from the new technology. • Rationale that the proposed trial will be easily understood by road users. • List of all interested parties and the likely level of up-take. • Information on consultation undertaken and/or proposed. • A plan for close monitoring of any field trial, especially in the early stages of implementation. • Prior to field testing, detail how the performance of the new technology will be assessed including any computer or other technical analysis used. The results of the field evaluation should show: • How the proposal affects each class of road user with respect to the desired outcome.

    • The level of understanding of the proposed device/application (obtained from road users
    

    through observation, interviews, or questionnaires).
    

• The reliability/performance of the device/application. • The information collected was well-defined and appropriate. • A sound scientific design was used with appropriate controls so that any conclusions reached are supported by robust statistical analysis. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 5222 SECTION 5 5 Set Up and Removal of Temporary Traffic Control Section 5 describes best practice procedures for implementing temporary traffic control from preparation before beginning to work, to the setup and removal of traffic control measures/devices. This section is of importance to any person designing, project managing, or physically providing or setting up traffic control.

    The set up or removal of traffic control (e.g., lane closures) on highways involves
    

an additional element of risk for traffic control workers and highway users until all devices are in place. +NOTE The principles and procedures set out below have been developed to minimize risks for all workers and highway users. Where competing risks need to be weighed, the safety of workers who are handling traffic control devices on the highway is considered paramount since these workers are the most vulnerable. As required by O.Reg. 213/91 and O.Reg. 145/00 under the OHSA, all workers, including TCP, responsible for on-site duties such as, installing or removing traffic control devices or measures must be:

1.  Competent workers.
2.  Aware of the requirements of the OHSA.
3.  Trained in the application of OTM Book 7.
4.  Capable of receiving written and oral instructions in a language easily understood.
5.  Not performing any other work while installing or removing traffic control devices or measures.
6.  Not performing any other work while directing vehicular traffic. Additionally, workers responsible for on-site duties must:

    • Not perform other functions while installing or removing traffic control devices (for TCP,
    

    see also Section 4).
    

    • Ensure that enough vehicles (including CT), signs, barriers, barricades, and markers are taken
    

to the work site to provide appropriate protection, and that TCP are available and on-site when required. If night-time protection is required, ensure that the appropriate devices are available. • Ensure that the vehicles, signs, barricades, and markers are in good and clean conditions and

    meet the applicable specifications, including minimum reflectivity levels (see Section 4).
    

• Cover or remove any conflicting, existing traffic control devices. • Record that the traffic control devices were installed according to the traffic control plan

    (or layout), as well as any modifications or deviations from the traffic control plan.
    

Where competing risks need to be weighed, the safety of the workers who are handling traffic control devices on the highway is considered paramount. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 5 223 SECTION 5 5.1 General Requirements Section 5.1 describes the general requirements for the set up and removal of temporary traffic control devices in a work zone.

    Workers who set up, use, or remove (take-down) work zone traffic control should apply the following
    

safety principles. These principles apply to both non-freeways and freeways. Set-up of work zone traffic control Set up work zone traffic control devices starting at the upstream end of the work zone and proceeding downstream. NOTE The following safety principles should be applied when setting up traffic control in a work zone

1.  Position work vehicles upstream of the work area rather than downstream so that flashing lights and/or flashing arrows indicate a visual presence and obstacle to drivers.
2.  Assemble and disassemble traffic control devices away from the highway. Where feasible, drop off traffic barrels along the shoulders adjacent to the lane closure in advance.
3.  AFADs, PLCS and PTTS should as much as possible, be partially or fully setup up and tested with any required settings or timings prior to being moved into position on the highway to minimize disruption to traffic. When moving any of these devices into position on the highway, the signalling displays should be turned off to reduce driver confusion.
4.  Set up work zone traffic control devices starting at the upstream end of the work zone and proceeding downstream.
5.  When installing a continuous line of channelizing devices, always place the channelizing devices in sequential order from the upstream end
6.  Reduce barrel spacing on the inside curves, on hills, in the immediate vicinity of ramps and the work area, and in the taper, if considered needed to reinforce the closure.
7.  Cones may be used for SD daytime work only (barrels are preferred)
8.  Maintain an offset of 0.3 metres to 0.6 metres between the flexible drums (barrels) and the edge of the travelled lane, if possible.
9.  When placing a traffic control device, ensure that it is not obscured by other objects.
10.  Where there are multiple lanes in one direction, and staggered signage is required on both the left and right shoulders, first place the signs on the opposite shoulder from the lane that is being closed, then place the signs on the same shoulder as the closed lane.
11.  Drive through the work zone on all approaches to ensure worker and public safety and to ensure all devices are installed and functioning as intended. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 5224 SECTION 5 Removal of advance signs must not take place until all other devices are removed. NOTE
12.  Cover, turn or remove signs and devices when they are not required. Remove the cover immediately before work at the work site begins.
13.  Ensure the layout is implemented as approved, record this information, and keep a copy available on site as part of the Traffic Control Plan and/or the Traffic Protection Plan.
14.  Ensure any operational adjustments to the layout are recorded with reasoning, date, and time.
15.  Approval may be required. Removal of work zone traffic control The following safety principles should be applied when removing traffic control in a work zone:
16.  Drive through the work zone before removal of traffic control devices to ensure that all workers are off the road, and that there are no gaps in the closure.
17.  Remove traffic control devices in the opposite order from which they

    were installed, starting with the closed lane(s), i.e., the last barrel (or
    

    cone) installed is the first barrel removed.+NOTE
    

3.  Advance signs are an exception. Remove advanced signs on the left and right shoulders in a downstream direction, in the same order they were installed. Removal of advanced signs must not be done until all other traffic control devices are removed.
4.  Do not face work vehicles upstream when removing lane closures except in unusual circumstances. Never face work vehicles upstream at night. 5.2 Freeway-Specific Requirements The following additional safety principles should be applied specifically for traffic control on a freeway:
5.  Use a CT to protect workers who are installing or removing lane closures (except when 3.0 metres or more from a live lane or when installing or removing advance signage on

    shoulders wide enough to park on). Refer to Section 4 for more information on CT and
    

their implementation. 2. Position and maintain the CT at an LIDG distance (see Table C) upstream of workers when lane closures are being installed or removed. 3. Install and remove freeway lane closures as quickly as possible, particularly the tapers. 4. Back up the CT and work vehicles during removal of lane closures to provide protection for downstream workers. Do not back CT and work vehicles into a live lane of traffic. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 5 225 SECTION 5 The ministry and other road authorities may approve the use of alternative procedures to suit certain situations. NOTE 5.2.1 Set up of Freeway Lane Closures The set up and removal of freeway lane closures are operations that require special consideration. The best practices outlined in this section must be used for provincial freeway lane closure, set ups and removals. The same procedures can be used on non-freeways, with or without a CT.+NOTE Road authorities may approve the use of alternative procedures or modifications of the procedures listed below to suit certain situations.

    5.2.1.1 Freeway Closure of Single Right or Left Lane (with Shoulders)
    

The procedure described below is for a single right lane closure on a freeway with a full shoulder on the right side. The same approach, with appropriate modifications, is to be used for a single left lane closure on a freeway with a full shoulder. Where feasible, a rolling closure should be used as the alternative. A. Preparation (Figure 5.1, Step A).

1.  Install signage on the shoulders in the advance warning and approach areas, as outlined in the Traffic Control Plan.
2.  Use a CT and a Sign Truck (ST), with installers, that is pulling one TC-12 arrow board trailer.
3.  Position the CT on the right shoulder, approximately 1 km to 2 km upstream of the beginning of the taper.
4.  Position the ST, with installers, and a detachable TC-12 arrow board trailer in the left arrow mode on the shoulder at the beginning of the lane closure taper. B. CT Enters the Roadway (Figure 5.1, Step B)
5.  When directed by the installers, the CT enters the traffic stream in the right lane with its flashing TC-12 arrow board in the left arrow mode and proceeds downstream. The CT gradually reduces its speed while monitoring upstream traffic to ensure that it is responding to the TC-12 flashing left arrow board. C. Installing the Taper (Figure 5.1, Step C)
6.  When the CT is at an LIDG distance (see Table C) from the start of the taper, the installers begin to retrieve barrels from the shoulder or vehicle, and sequentially place them at TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 5226 SECTION 5 Step A Step B Step C Step D 1–2 km TC-12

The CT shadows the ST at an LIDG distance in line with the position of the installers. D. Completing the Taper and LBA (Figure 5.1, Step D)

1.  When the open lane width outside the taper becomes too narrow for the CT not to encroach into the adjacent lane, the CT drives through the barrels and continues to shadow the ST at an LIDG distance, moving parallel to the taper.
2.  As the last barrel of the taper is installed, the ST detaches its TC-12 arrow board trailer at the end of the taper and positions it in the lane being closed in left arrow mode, ensuring 4WF/360° is activated. Room is provided to ensure that the CT can pass the arrow board trailer on the right.
3.  The installers then begin to install the barrels for the LBA downstream of the ST. The CT moves downstream, maintaining a separation distance of LIDG to the ST.
4.  When the CT reaches the TC-12 arrow board trailer at the end of the taper, the CT drives around the trailer on the right and repositions itself at an LIDG distance from the ST in the lane being closed.
5.  The remaining barrels for the longitudinal buffer, work, and termination areas are installed in a downstream direction with the CT following the ST at an LIDG distance.

    5.2.1.2 Freeway Closure of Two Right or Left Lanes (with Shoulders)
    

The procedure described below is for a two right lane closure of a freeway with full shoulders on the right. A similar approach with appropriate modifications is to be used for a two left lane closure with shoulders. Where feasible, a rolling closure should be used as the alternative. A. Preparation (Figure 5.2, Step A)

1.  A CT and a ST, with installers, that is pulling a TC-12 arrow board trailer is to be used along with a TC-12 trailer pre-positioned on the right shoulder or towed in tandem on the right shoulder, at the downstream end of the first taper. B. First Taper and Tangent (Figure 5.2, Step B)
2.  The procedure detailed in Section 5.2.1.1 for a single right lane closure is used to install

    the first taper in the right-most (outer) lane.
    

2.  When the end of the right-most lane taper is reached, the TC-12 arrow board pre- positioned on the shoulder is brought over from the shoulder and positioned in the centre of the lane at the end of the taper in the left arrow mode.
3.  The installers then begin to install the barrels for the tangent or parallel section. The CT shadows the ST at an LIDG distance.
4.  When the CT reaches the TC-12 arrow board at the end of the first taper, the CT drives around the TC-12 on the right and repositions itself at an LIDG distance from the ST in the lane that is being closed. C. Second Taper (Figure 5.2, Step C)
5.  The remaining barrels for the parallel section are installed in a downstream direction with the CT following the ST at an LIDG distance. • A TC-3R is installed in the parallel section. • A TC-4L is installed at the start of the second taper. • The CT drives around the TC-3R and TC-4L on the right.
6.  When the parallel section has been installed, the installers place the barrels for the second taper. • The CT shadows the ST at an LIDG distance. • When the end of the second taper is reached, the ST detaches its trailer-mounted TC-12 and leaves it in the left arrow mode.
7.  After detaching the TC-12, the sign truck must ensure its 4WF/360° are activated. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 5228 SECTION 5 Left lane closure is mirror image of right lane closure. Step A Step B Step C Step D A 1–2 km

\See Figure 5.3 and Table D.

    5.2.1.3 Freeway Closure of One or Two Right or Left Lanes (No Shoulder
    

    on Roadway Side where Lanes are being Closed)
    

This procedure describes a freeway closure for: • Two left lanes where the left shoulder is too narrow to permit a CT to use that shoulder to drive around a TC-12 sign trailer positioned in the adjacent lane. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 5 229 SECTION 5 • Two right lanes where the right shoulder is too narrow to permit a CT to use that shoulder to drive around a TC-12 sign trailer positioned in the adjacent lane. If only the left-most or right-most lane is to be closed, and there is a narrow or minimal shoulder, the procedures used are the same, although the steps related to the closure of the second lane are omitted and only one CT is required. A. Preparation (Figure 5.3, Step A)

1.  Install signage on the shoulders in the advance warning and approach areas as outlined in the Traffic Control Plan. A CT is not required if it will take less than 30 minutes and there is no encroachment into the adjacent traffic lane. Signage is installed either on both sides of the freeway if space permits, or on the right side of the highway by using double signage.
2.  If the ST that is installing advance signage must encroach into the adjacent live lane, a CT must be used to protect the ST, located at an LIDG distance upstream of the ST.
3.  A convoy of lane closure work vehicles is positioned on the right shoulder or an on-ramp,

    approximately 1 km to 2 km upstream of the beginning (upstream end) of the taper.
    

4.  Starting at the upstream end, the convoy consists of: • CT1 and CT2. • A ST with a TC-12 arrow board trailer and installers.

    • A Work Truck (WT) loaded with barrels. The WT is needed as the barrels cannot be
    

placed on the left shoulder in advance of the lane closure operation as there is no shoulder, and not all the barrels required can be carried in the ST. B. Positioning the Convoy (Figure 5.3, Step B)

1.  The convoy enters the traffic stream from the right side.
2.  The convoy gradually changes lanes until it enters the left-most lane. • The TC-12 on the ST trailer, CT1, and CT2, are in flashing bar mode until they enter the left-most lane, at which time the CT operators use their in-cab switches to change their TC-12 to the right arrow mode. • The WT operates with the 4WF/360° activated. The convoy slowly decreases in speed.
3.  CT1 and CT2 monitor upstream traffic to ensure that it is responding to the flashing right arrow. If the traffic is responding, the convoy slows to a stop such that: • CT2 is positioned at an LIDG distance upstream of the start of the taper. • CT1 stays at an LIDG distance upstream of CT2. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 5230 SECTION 5 C. First Taper and Tangent (Figure 5.3, Step C)
4.  The ST and WT are positioned downstream of the start of the taper. The installers remove barrels from the ST and quickly install them for the first taper at the appropriate spacing provided in Table C Work Zone Component Dimensions: Freeways.
5.  CT1 and CT2 move forward as the installers move forward. CT2 maintains an LIDG distance upstream of the installers. CT1 stays an LIDG distance upstream of CT2.
6.  CT2 moves through the taper when the lane width outside the taper becomes too narrow for the CT not to encroach into the adjacent lane and maintains an LIDG distance upstream of the installers as they continue to install the barrels and close the lane over a

    distance of 300 metres (see Table C).
    

4.  CT1 follows CT2 through the taper when the lane width outside the taper becomes too narrow for the CT not to encroach into the adjacent lane.
5.  The whole convoy moves ahead and approaches the end of the first taper. D. Second Taper (Figure 5.3, Step D)
6.  When CT1 reaches the end of the taper, it parks at an LBA distance from the end of the taper with its TC-12 in the right arrow mode. The CT1 driver/operator leaves CT1 on the left and joins the installers.
7.  The barrels in the tangent or parallel section are then installed in a downstream direction with CT2 following the installers at an LIDG distance.
8.  A TC-3 is installed in the parallel section as far to the right as possible. When CT2 reaches TC-3, it passes TC-3 on the left.
9.  Once the parallel section has been installed, placement of the barrels for the second taper in the second lane begins. • TC-4 is installed at the start of the second taper. • CT2 drives around TC-4 on the left and moves forward, parallel to the taper, maintaining an LIDG distance to the ST. • When the end of the second taper is reached, the ST detaches its TC-12 trailer and installs it in the second lane in the right arrow mode.
10.  The ST then pulls into the left-most lane and moves downstream, leaving the installation area.
11.  CT2 pulls to the left around the TC-12 arrow board trailer at the end of the second taper and back into the second lane that is being closed. E. Second LBA (Figure 5.3, Step E)
12.  CT2 maintains an LIDG distance to the installers. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 5 231 SECTION 5

1.  The ST and barrel installers (now removers) are positioned at the downstream end of the termination area, at the last barrel installed. The CT is located at an LIDG distance upstream of the ST. The removers work downstream of the ST.
2.  The traffic barrels are removed in the reverse direction in which they were installed, so that the last barrel installed is the first removed. The barrels are set on the shoulder for later re-use or retrieval.
3.  The ST and CT slowly back up through the termination area, work area, and LBA as the barrels are removed, maintaining the same relative spacing and positioning throughout. B. Removing the Taper (Figure 5.4, Step B)
4.  When the CT comes to the TC-12 trailer at the downstream end of the lane closure taper, it backs around the TC-12 on the right side and positions itself at an LIDG distance upstream of the TC-12.
5.  When the lane closure removers come to the TC-12, they place it on the shoulder for later retrieval.
6.  The CT then backs up parallel to the taper barrels on the downstream side of the barrels. The CT maintains an LIDG distance to the ST as the barrels are quickly moved to the shoulder by the removers. C. Leaving the Construction Site (Figure 5.4, Step C)
7.  When the CT reaches the last barrel in the taper, it will be on the shoulder of the highway. The last barrels are quickly moved to the shoulder as the CT backs up on the shoulder while maintaining an LIDG distance to the removers.
8.  The ST and CT then proceed downstream to the next interchange. • The ST circles around, drives downstream on the right shoulder and removes the signs in the order in which they were installed in the advance warning and approach areas by using a VSD operation. • The ST then circles around and removes any advance signs on the left side of the highway in a similar manner.
9.  Depending on the duration of the project, the barrels on the right shoulder may either be removed or left there for re-installation. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 5 233 SECTION 5

    5.2.2.2 Removal of Two Right or Two Left Lane Closure (Freeway with
    

    Shoulders)
    

The procedure described below is for the removal of a two right lane closure with shoulders. A similar

    approach (with necessary and appropriate modifications) is to be used for the removal of a two left
    

lane closure with shoulders. A. Removing the Second Lane Tangent (Figure 5.5, Step A)

1.  The ST and the lane closure installers (now removers) are positioned in the right lane at the downstream end of the termination area, at the last barrel installed. The CT is in the second lane upstream of the ST at an LIDG distance.
2.  The barrels are removed in the reverse direction in which they were installed, so that the last barrel installed is the first removed. The barrels are set on the shoulder for later re-use or retrieval.
3.  The ST and CT slowly back up through the termination area, work area, and LBA as the barrels are removed. The CT maintains an LIDG distance upstream of the ST. B. Removing the Second Lane Taper (Figure 5.5, Step B)
4.  The CT backs up until it comes to the TC-12 trailer at the downstream end of the centre lane closure taper. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 5234 SECTION 5

2.  The CT backs around the TC-12 on the right side and positions itself at an LIDG distance upstream of the TC-12 in the centre lane taper. When the removers come to the TC-12, they place it on the shoulder for later retrieval.
3.  The CT backs up parallel to the taper barrels on the downstream side of the barrels. The CT maintains an LIDG distance to the ST. The removers work in front of the ST as the taper barrels are moved to the shoulder.
4.  When the CT reaches the last barrel in the centre lane taper, it backs down the parallel section with the ST at an LIDG distance downstream of the CT.
5.  The removers continue to remove the barrels and as they approach them, the TC-4 and TC-3 signs are also taken away. C. Removing the Right Lane Tangent and Taper (Figure 5.5, Step C and Step D)
6.  The rest of the lane closure removal is the same as the removal of a single right lane

    closure (see Section 5.2.2.1).

\See Figure 5.3 and Table D. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 5 235 SECTION 5 5.2.2.3 Removal of Two Right or Two Left Lane Freeway Closure

    (No Shoulder on Roadway Side where Lanes are being Closed)
    

This procedure describes the removal of a freeway closure of two left lanes where there is no shoulder or a minimal shoulder on the left side of the highway and is similar to the removal of a freeway closure of two right lanes with no or minimal right shoulder. If only the left lane has been closed, the procedure is essentially the same, except that the steps related to the removal of the closure of the second lane are omitted. A. Preparation (Figure 5.6, Step A)

1.  The lane closure installers (now removers) and the WT are in the second lane at the downstream end of the termination area.
2.  CT2 is in the second lane at an LIDG distance upstream of the WT with its arrow board sign in arrow mode.
3.  A ST is in the left-most lane beside CT2.
4.  All three vehicles back up through the lane closure, maintaining the same spacing and positioning throughout, as the barrels are removed in the reverse order in which they were installed and are placed in the WT. B. Removal of TC-12, Second Lane Tangent and Second Lane Taper (Figure 5.6, Step B)
5.  When CT2 reaches TC-12 at the downstream end of the second lane taper, it backs around TC-12 on the left side and positions itself at an LIDG distance upstream of TC-12 in the taper with its arrow board in the right flashing mode.
6.  The ST hooks up the TC-12 trailer and tows it out of the closure to a storage area with the arrow board collapsed and switched off.
7.  The lane taper barrels are removed and placed in the WT.
8.  CT2 backs up parallel to the taper as the barrels are removed, maintaining an LIDG distance upstream of the WT.
9.  CT2 backs around TC-4 into the parallel section with its TC-12 arrow board in the right arrow mode. The removers remove TC-4 and work upstream, removing the parallel section barrels. C. Removal of Left Lane Tangent (Figure 5.6, Step C)
10.  As the parallel section barrels are removed, CT2 backs up in the parallel section and around TC-3.
11.  The removers remove TC-3 and work upstream, removing the parallel section barrels, until they reach CT1 at the downstream end of the first taper. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 5236 SECTION 5 D. Removal of Left Lane Tangent and Taper (Figure 5.6, Step D)
12.  CT2 and the WT leave the work area, turn around at the next interchange and circle back to the upstream end of the first taper. CT2 slows to a stop in the left-most lane at an LIDG distance upstream of the start of the taper.
13.  The removers exit the WT on the left and quickly remove the barrels in the first taper and load them into the WT.
14.  CT2 moves forward as the WT moves forward, maintaining an LIDG distance upstream of the WT.
15.  When the end of the first taper is reached, CT1, the WT, and CT2 move off in a convoy.
16.  The ST, protected by a CT that is shadowing it at an LIDG distance, picks up any advance signs on the left and right shoulders in a downstream direction.

\See Figure 5.3 and Table D. 5.2.3 Freeway Zone Painting A stationary LBA must not be used for mobile work operations, as it increases the risk of an out-of- control vehicle striking the back of the CT in the longitudinal direction. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 5 237 SECTION 5 To mitigate this risk, contractors and staff who are working for the MTO in zone striping operations on high speed, multi-lane provincial highways must meet the following requirements:

    • Use one CT to shadow the zone striper at an LIDG distance (i.e., CT3 (see US-12, DS-12, or
    

    FS-5)).
    

    • Add two additional CT upstream of CT3 (i.e., CT1 and CT2).
    

• CT2 shadows CT3 at a distance of 100 metres to 300 metres. • CT1 shadows CT2 at a distance of 300 metres to 600 metres. The additional CT are spaced out depending on highway geometrics and the time that it takes for the paint to dry. In addition, where shoulder conditions and geometrics will permit: • A pre-warning ST with an overhead beacon shadows CT1 at a distance of 500 metres to 800 metres on the right shoulder with a sign that reads,

    “Road Painting – Left (or Right) Lane – 2 km”. +NOTE
    

• A pre-warning ST is not required on high traffic volume, urban freeways

    with physical space limitations (e.g., within the city limits of Toronto or
    

    Ottawa).
    

• It is recognized that zone striping operations on municipal highways do not require the same degree of protection required on multi-lane high speed, provincial freeways. 5.2.4 Freeway Paving The following guidelines apply to paving operations on freeways: • Construction regulations under the OHSA include paving as a mobile operation and require the use of BV for freeway paving operations. While paving operations progressively move along the highway, they do so very slowly, at only a few kilometres each day. +NOTE • In terms of traffic control required, paving operations are similar to SD or LD stationary operations and treated as such in the layouts in Book 7, which fully complies with the traffic control requirements for mobile operations as

    prescribed in Section 67 (12) of the construction regulations.
    

• Layouts that are labelled “Mobile Operations” do not apply to paving operations.

    • A reduced regulatory speed limit of 80 km/h (black/white) must be used, and enforced by
    

police or pace vehicles, at times when work is being performed. The reduced speed limit signs must be covered when no work is being performed. It is recognized that zone striping operations on municipal highways do not require the same degree of protection required on multi-lane high speed, provincial freeways. NOTE Layouts that are labelled “Mobile Operations” do not apply to paving operations. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 5238 SECTION 5 • PVMS may be placed on one or both sides of the highway, 500 metres in advance of the

    work zone, to warn motorists of the reduced speed (supplementing UG-2, DG-2, and FG-2).
    

PVMS that advise of a lane closure should be positioned upstream of the expected ends of queues. • To enhance visibility for motorists, the machinery used in paving operations should have conspicuity tape appropriately applied.

1.  A note in brackets under/beside a sign name or within a box (ie. (NPRS 70 km/h or greater) or

    (Long Duration)) indicates the sign is only required when that criterion is present.
    

2.  The TC-1 and TC-2 are both required for Long Duration operations. The TC-1 is to be installed and remain in place continuously for the duration of the project. The TC-2 is to be in place to indicate workers are present and also indicates the start of the approach area. Additional TC-2 signs should be included in each work area within a long work zone that has multiple work areas. The TC-2 must be removed, covered, or dismounted and placed faced down when workers are not present. For SD only the TC-2 is required.
3.  The TC-1A and TC-1B are not always shown on the Layouts. The TC-1A is required for Long Duration rural or freeway operations. Long Duration Freeway operations also require the TC-1B.
4.  A work area, as shown on the Layouts, may or may not contain a work vehicle depending on the work activity. A work vehicle may be used as a traffic control device only as shown on the Layouts. If used as a traffic control device the work vehicle must have either four-way

    flashers (4WF) plus 360 Beacon, rotating LED amber lights, or TC-12 as indicated. Where a
    

work vehicle is present with 4WF plus 360 Beacon, rotating LED amber lights, and/or TC-12 the work vehicle can replace markers only where indicated in the Layouts. 5. The regulatory maximum speed posted on a highway applies under normal conditions; that is, when no construction zone or work activity is present. Guideline provisions required in OTM Book 7 are based on normal posted regulatory speed, and not on temporarily reduced construction zone regulatory or advisory speeds. 6. An end taper on shoulder work is optional but encouraged. 7. Lane encroachments on freeways are not recommended except where necessary for some mobile maintenance activities. For mobile operations use FS-1 maintaining a 3.5 m lane width. For stationary operations use FS-3 or FS-7. 8. Lane closed means lane closed or occupied. 9. Signs and devices are oriented on the Layouts in the direction of travel they are intended to provide guidance to. 10. Signs that are shown on the Layouts with a 60 m offset indicate the sign is to be repeated on the opposite shoulder. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 6254 SECTION 6 11. The typical layouts are categorized by the geometrics of the roadway (two-lane, multi-lane

    non-freeway, freeway, roundabout, intersection), number and location of closed/occupied
    

lanes, and the duration of work. They are applicable to all types of work operations, including planning, surveying and other pre-engineering activities. The only exceptions are Paving and Painting operations. Paving operations, although included as mobile operations by Ministry of Labour Trades and

    Skills Development (MLTSD), are considered stationary operations for the purpose of traffic
    

    control and the appropriate SD or LD typical should be used (not mobile).
    

Layouts specific to Painting operations are shown in TS-11, US-12, DS-12, FS-5, TI-4 to TI-7, UI-1 to UI-6, and DI-1 to DI-6. For additional requirements for Freeway Zone Painting and Freeway Paving operations see Section 5.2.3 and Section 5.2.4 of the office edition. 12. As required by OHSA and its regulations, Temporary Construction Barrier System (TCBS) must be used for stationary operations on freeways, to separate workers from traffic, where the duration of the work is longer than five days. Barrier-mounted delineators should be used with TCBS. Where TCBS are not feasible on freeways and a 3.0 m minimum lateral clearance from a live lane of traffic cannot be achieved, an LBA plus BV plus LIDG must be used. TCBS should also be considered for use on non-freeways where the duration is longer than five days, to separate workers from traffic or to separate opposing traffic on multi-lane undivided roads. 13. Use of BV

    Freeways:
    

    All Buffer Vehicles (BV) used on freeways must be Crash Trucks (CT).
    

For operations that require five days or less to complete, or where barriers are not feasible, CT and both an LBA and LIDG are required for stationary operations and one or more CT are required for mobile operations. CT are not required on freeways where a lateral off set of 3.0 m or more exists between the work area and traffic. CT are not required for ID and VSD work on freeway shoulders. CT are required for Mobile operations on freeway shoulders. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022SECTION 6 255 SECTION 6 Non-Freeways: BVs are not specifically required on non-freeways under the MLTSD regulations. If a BV is used on a non-freeway, the appropriate LBA and LIDG should be used for stationary operations. On multi-lane roads for normal posted regulatory speeds of 70 km/h or higher, a CT is preferred over a blocker truck. 14. Where a Layout for ID is not presented in Table G for a listed Configuration it is not feasible to set-up, do the work, and take down the required devices within 15 minutes therefore the measures for VSD work must be used. 15. Where a Layout for VSD is not presented in Table G for a listed Configuration it is not feasible to set-up, do the work, and take down the required devices within 30 minutes therefore the measures for SD work must be used. 16. Approval of the Road Authority is required for use of traffic control devices not shown in OTM Book 7. 17. Layouts in OTM Book 7 meet most common scenarios. For situations not shown in OTM Book 7 or when Layouts require modifications to accommodate site specific conditions follow the fundamental principles in Sections 2, 3, and 4 of OTM Book 7 Office Edition.

Hence, each road authority should have specific policies in place, including trainings, for unplanned events and emergency responses. A.1.1 Scope Traffic control is one component of incident management at an unplanned event. Traffic control is the element that: • Helps to secure the scene. • Protects other highway users. • Provides responders with the opportunity to safely deploy necessary actions. Appendix A provides guidelines to responders on:

    • Recommended personal protective equipment (PPE).
    

• Traffic control devices. • Progressive staging of traffic control with typical set up procedures. The guidelines are based on Section 3.1 Fundamental Principles of Work Zone Design of OTM Book 7. Users should be familiar with both Appendix A and Section 3 as a reference. The information provided is directed toward: • Operations personnel. • First and secondary responders who are responsible for establishing, maintaining, monitoring, modifying, and removing any traffic control at an incident scene or other unplanned event. Table A.1, below, identifies typical responders and their roles and responsibilities for traffic control.

Appendix A is a general guidance and each road authority should have specific policies in place for unplanned events and emergency responses. NOTE A.1.2 Definition of Unplanned Events Temporary traffic control for construction, maintenance, or scheduled activities, although unique to each location, allows for planning, documentation, and application of the fundamental principles detailed in OTM Book 7. An unplanned event refers to any incident that occurs without advance notice of time and location which disrupts normal traffic flow and/or presents a hazard to highway users. An unplanned event requires prompt scene management by all responders. Unplanned events include, but are not limited to, the following situations: +NOTE • Unplanned infrastructure maintenance such as watermain breaks, fallen poles or signs, bridge/highway washout.

    • Vehicle(s)/highway user collision, medical emergencies.
    

• Vehicle breakdown/fires. An unplanned event refers to any incident that occurs without advance notice of time and location which disrupts normal traffic flow and/or presents a hazard to highway users. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX A: UNPLANNED EVENTS 485

    • Debris on highway - those from nature, objects, spills (including dangerous goods).
    

    • Environmental Safety Hazards (i.e. severe snow, rain, fog).
    

    • Off-highway incidents that affect traffic (i.e. impaired visibility due to fire and smoke
    

    located off-highway).
    

• Pedestrian involved incidents. • Police investigation not involving an active collision scene. • Informal and unplanned demonstrations such as protest acts. A.1.3 Traffic Control Guidelines It is extremely difficult to establish a clearly defined traffic control zone under emergencies or other unplanned conditions, especially upon arrival. The securing of a scene takes time, and set up should be a progressive activity based on: • Personnel. • Equipment. • Critical needs of the incident. On-scene traffic control needs can dynamically change as the response efforts progress. See Table A.2 Progression of Traffic Control. The first priority upon arrival is to establish initial traffic control that provides a safe work area for responders and the public and minimizes the chance of secondary crashes. Traffic control device placement is impacted by: • Expected duration of the incident. • Location.

    • Prevailing traffic conditions (i.e., volume, speed).
    

• Weather and visibility. Upon arrival, responders should make an estimate of:

1.  The magnitude of the incident, then:
2.  The expected duration for recovery. Traffic control can then be progressively established based on this estimate. A preferred sequence would go from:
3.  Full highway closure, to
4.  Directional lane closure, to TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX A: UNPLANNED EVENTS486
5.  Multiple lanes, to
6.  Single lane, and to
7.  Shoulder closure until the incident is fully resolved and traffic flow returns to normal. Lane Closures • The initial closure should only be as required to ensure protection of the scene. For example, if only multiple lanes need to be closed, the progressive set up should start from Point 3, above. • Highway lane closure must be managed so that only the lanes that are necessary to protect the responders, victims, and investigation are closed. Every effort should be made to minimize the amount of time that these lanes are closed. • The number of closed lanes may change several times during clearance efforts, so traffic control needs to be established and then monitored/changed to fit changing conditions. This should be a coordinated approach between all response agencies as the locations

    and timelines are affected (i.e., relocation of traffic control devices and resources).
    

• As resources with traffic control devices/equipment arrive, traffic control should be adjusted to work towards an OTM Book 7 compliant format. Table A.2 Progression of Traffic Control Upon Arrival

1.  At any incident where there is encroachment into a live traffic lane, only

    person(s) qualified under the Highway Traffic Act (HTA) can provide
    

temporary traffic control. If not already present, the appropriate police agency and/or road authority shall be notified that traffic control is required. All other response vehicles shall park in a safe location until initial traffic control is established. 2. Ensure all emergency lights are operating as you approach the scene. 3. Conduct an initial scene survey to identify hazards and evaluate the situation. 4. Begin the establishment of an emergency traffic control zone by slowly coming to a stop and positioning the emergency response vehicle to provide initial safety to the scene. 5. All personnel who leave emergency vehicles must wear appropriate high-visibility safety apparel at a minimum. This includes all responders, regardless of duties in the emergency traffic control zone. Some road authorities and agencies will have higher standards of PPE use than the minimum requirements. Initial Set up 6. When practicable, place cones and/or flares to form an initial taper with devices on hand. 7. Position additional responder vehicles to enhance establishment of traffic control zone or direct to park in an appropriate location. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX A: UNPLANNED EVENTS 487 Initial Set up 8. If required, call for additional resources to secure the scene (i.e., road

    authority, “safety support vehicle”, additional traffic control devices, etc.).
    

Enhanced Traffic Control 9. Place appropriate advisory signs in the advance warning area as soon as possible. 10. Expand taper and cone placements for highway conditions and estimated on-scene time. 11. If required, utilize appropriate person(s) to direct traffic on non-freeways and other available traffic control devices, including the use of ramp closure gates. Ongoing Traffic Control 12. When an extended duration scene of more than two hours is anticipated, additional traffic control devices shall be provided as shown in OTM Book

    7 for a planned event of the expected duration (short duration (SD) or long
    

    duration (LD)).
    

13.  All safety procedures must remain in place until the incident is terminated

    (all personnel, hazards, emergency and related vehicles, and equipment are
    

    removed from the highway).
    

A.1.4 Unified Command Command needs to be established from the first arriving responder at an incident or unplanned event. The responsibility of the Incident Commander is to: • Stabilize the environment. • Stabilize the scene. • Stabilize any patients before beginning operations. • Provide potential ingress and egress routes for responding units. Depending on the availability of emergency responders, the typical first arriving responder may vary between jurisdictions. As well, the Incident Commander may change among the first responders as the incident progresses. For example: Incident Situation Appropriate Incident Commander

1.  Medical treatment is required for patients where no

    extrication is required and there is no risk of fire (or
    

other safety hazards, but significant resources are

    required to transport the injured parties).
    

EMS 2. Extrication is required or there is risk of a fire. Fire Department 3. Patient(s) stabilized or transported from the scene, or the fire extinguished. Focus of command changes to perimeter safety of all parties and expediting traffic flow. Police TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX A: UNPLANNED EVENTS488 A.2 Guidelines for First on Scene A.2.1 Identification of Hazards and Scene Evaluation The first responder to an unplanned event should conduct an initial scene survey to identify site specific hazards and evaluate the situation. Placement of vehicles and traffic control devices will be impacted by the unique conditions of each scene. The purpose of traffic control is to: • Provide protection to responders and the public. • Provide guidance to highway users. Any potential hazards to responders or highway users should be identified, and traffic control adjusted accordingly. Hazards that may affect traffic control include: • Poor visibility due to weather.+NOTE • Limited/obstructed sight lines – hills, curves, trees, signs, etc. • Increased highway user reaction time required due to highway conditions – wet, icy, snow covered. • Impact of highway type – gravel, paved, current surface conditions. • Prevailing traffic characteristics – observed speed, volume, percent of heavy vehicles.

    • Impacts from type or level of lighting – artificial illumination (night), sun direction, dusk/
    

dawn. • Potential impending environmental impacts – debris, chemical leak, etc. • Estimated on-scene time. A.2.2 Estimated On-Scene Time – Extended Duration Scene The first responder to an unplanned event should: • Make an estimate of the expected on-scene time.

    • Determine the adequacy of the resources on hand (vehicles, cones/flares, personnel) to
    

maintain traffic control for the entire duration and various stages of the event. It is recommended that first responder organizations within a jurisdiction develop an incident command protocol. NOTE Any potential hazards to responders or highway users should be identified, and traffic control adjusted accordingly. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX A: UNPLANNED EVENTS 489 • Request additional resources as soon as practicable. Extended duration scenes are typically traffic incidents that involve:+NOTE • Dangerous goods. • Fatal traffic crashes that involve numerous vehicles. • Other natural or human-made disasters. Extended duration scene traffic incidents typically involve the closure of all or part of a highway facility for a period that exceeds two hours. Examples include: • Chain reaction crashes. • Crashes that require a significant medical response, coroner response, and/or crash

    reconstruction response (e.g., fatalities).
    

    • Incidents that involve advanced, prolonged environmental cleanup (e.g., incidents that
    

    involve dangerous goods).
    

• Incidents that involve structural damage to highway infrastructure. • Incidents that involve a mass evacuation. A mass evacuation could lead to prolonged incident response in areas outside of the immediately affected zone. • Wildfires near the highway. If an extended duration scene is anticipated, additional equipment, vehicles, and personnel must be called in to provide temporary traffic control as per OTM Book 7. A.2.3 Lane Closure and Traffic Direction

    Under the HTA, only the following are permitted to close a live lane(s) and/or direct traffic.
    

• Police. • Firefighters. • Road authority. If first on scene, EMS responders should block lanes effectively closed by the incident as required, to protect the incident area until additional responders arrive. At any incident where there is encroachment into a live traffic lane, if not already present: • The appropriate police agency and/or road authority shall be notified that traffic control is required. Extended duration scene traffic incidents typically involve the closure of all or part of a highway facility for a period that exceeds two hours. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX A: UNPLANNED EVENTS490 • All other response vehicles, such as service and/or tow vehicles shall park in a safe location until initial traffic control is established. A.3 Equipment and Devices A.3.1 High Visibility Safety Apparel All employers must ensure that all workers who are exposed to the hazards of passing traffic are

    wearing High Visibility Safety Apparel (HVSA) appropriate for the circumstances.
    

All emergency responders, including secondary support, shall wear HVSA if they are: • Setting up/removing traffic control devices. • Directing traffic. • Working within three metres of a live lane.

    Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA):
    

    Consistent with the General Duty under Section 25(2)(h) of the OHSA:
    

• Employers are required to take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances to protect workers. • Employers of emergency first responders engaged in various non-construction type activities e.g., police, fire, ambulance, are responsible for conducting an assessment of traffic hazards to determine which type of high visibility garments are appropriate. The Construction Projects regulation requires that: • Any worker who may be endangered by vehicular traffic on a project must wear a garment that covers the upper body and provides a high level of visibility. • Some specifics of that garment can be found In Section 69.1 of O.Reg. 213/91 of the OHSA. For example, if the garment is a vest, it must have an adjustable fit and a side and front

    tear-away feature. This regulation specifies the performance criteria (i.e., chromaticity/
    

    luminance) for the required background material, front and back stripes, or silver
    

nighttime stripes for arms, legs, or sides. High Visibility Requirements:

    Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Standard Z96-15, American National Standard ANSI/ISEA 107-
    

    2015, or European National Standard EN-471 (EN ISO 20471: 2013) may be used to:
    

• Establish reasonable performance criteria for high visibility garments to protect workers on a case-by-case basis. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX A: UNPLANNED EVENTS 491 • Provide recommendations for the selection of appropriate HVSA and sets out performance criteria for high visibility garments.

    The CSA’s current standard (CSA Z96-15) for high visibility safety apparel classifies HVSA by the extent
    

of body coverage: • Class 3 - greatest body coverage and visibility under poor light conditions and at great distance. • Class 2 - moderate body coverage and superior visibility. • Class 1 - lowest recognized coverage and good visibility. The selection of apparel class is dependent on a case-by-case scenario based on the level of risk associated with the task. Table A.3 outlines some example scenarios of when each class of HVSA may be applicable. Table A.3 Scenario Examples of Appropriate HVSA Class Selection Based on Risk Level Level of Risk Applicable HVSA Class Examples of Situations Examples of Jobs Low Risk Class 2 or Class 1

    (not
    

    recommended)
    

• When vehicles are moving

    slowly (e.g., less than
    

    40 km/h).
    

• Worker’s activities permit a continuous consciousness of approaching traffic. • When there is ample separation between the worker on foot and the traffic. • When work backgrounds are not complex, allowing for optimal visibility. • Workers directing vehicle operators to parking or service locations. • “Right-of-Way” or sidewalk maintenance workers. Medium Risk Class 2 or Class 3 • When vehicles or equipment are moving between 40-80 km/h. • When workers are performing tasks that divert attention from approaching vehicle traffic. • When work activities are in closer proximity to vehicles

    (in or near flowing vehicle
    

    traffic).
    

• Roadway construction, utility, or railway workers. • Survey crews. • School crossing guards. • Parking and/or toll gate workers. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX A: UNPLANNED EVENTS492 Level of Risk Applicable HVSA Class Examples of Situations Examples of Jobs Medium Risk

    (continued)
    

Class 2 or Class 3 • When work backgrounds are complex. • Workers who require greater visibility under inclement weather conditions or low light. • Emergency response personnel. • Members of law enforcement. • Collision site investigators. High Risk Class 2 for daytime or Class 3 for low-light conditions • When vehicle speeds exceeding 80 km/h. • Workers on foot and vehicle operators with high task loads that clearly place the worker in danger. • When the worker must be conspicuous through the full range of body motions at a minimum of 390 m. • Work activities taking place in low light or at nighttime. • Roadway construction, utility, or railway workers. • Survey crews. • Emergency responders. • Road assistance/ courtesy patrols. • Flagging crews. • Towing operators. For emergency responders, CSA Class 2 or 3 HVSA should be used, within the limitations of the equipment necessary to perform their duties. For details on the exact specifications of size, coverage, fit, brightness, design, colour, care, and maintenance, reference to CSA Standard Z96-15 is highly recommended. Typically, first responder uniforms do not meet the OHSA requirement. Hence, while on the highway, their uniforms should be supplemented with an appropriate PPE. For example, most Fire Fighter bunker gear does not meet the reflectivity performance requirements of CSA Standard Z96-15 High-

    Visibility Safety Apparel. Therefore, firefighter(s) who are controlling traffic using traffic control STOP
    

or SLOW signs are required to wear high visibility safety apparel while performing this work. Personnel working within a safe zone established by blocker apparatus or police shall wear safety vests. Personnel wearing self-contained breathing apparatus or other specialized PPE such as Hazmat suits do not require safety vests but must be protected within a safe zone established by blocker apparatus or police. For emergency responders, CSA Class 2 or 3 HVSA should be used, within the limitations of the equipment necessary to perform their duties. NOTE BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX A: UNPLANNED EVENTS 493 High Visibility garments that comply with the previous CSA Z96-09 standard are considered acceptable if in good condition, however, when old high visibility garments are replaced, they should be replaced with high visibility garments that meet the current CSA Z96-15 standard. The following resources may be able to assist workplace parties and raise awareness about the hazards associated with work activities on/near highways: • Public Services Health and Safety Association. • Infrastructure Health and Safety Association. • Workplace Safety and Prevention Services. • Workplace Safety North. • HSO - Health & Safety Ontario. A.3.2 Vehicle Lights and Flares Flashing lights on emergency response vehicles are used to enhance the safety of response personnel and incident victims and are essential in the initial response stage. They may be: • Red, white, amber, blue, and/or green in colour.

    • Capable of high intensity rotating and/or light emitting diode (LED) wigwag, oscillating, or
    

strobe. • Mounted outside as well as inside. Flashing lights on emergency response vehicles provide visibility and give immediate information to the travelling public of an emergency. Use of flashing lights must comply with the Highway Traffic Act

    (HTA).
    

Too many warning lights can be confusing to drivers. Flashing lights should be used with discipline and discretion to minimize the impact on traffic flow. As practicable, it is recommended that once good traffic control is established at the incident scene, their use should be reduced such that: • Only amber, rather than red/blue, warning lights remain on once full OTM Book 7 compliant traffic control is in place. If deemed necessary due to visibility issues, such as fog, red/blue lights may be continued. • The number of lights is minimized to avoid creating glare for motorists and reduce “rubber necking” behavior.

    • No (or minimal) forward-facing (into oncoming traffic) emergency lighting is occurring.
    

Emergency response vehicles should be capable of turning off headlights when the responder determines necessary. • Emergency response vehicles should have day and night settings for vehicle lights. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX A: UNPLANNED EVENTS494 • Tow vehicle beacons are deactivated once no longer needed to protect workers or public, i.e., after the vehicle is travelling with the traffic stream without a vehicle in tow. • Appropriate incident commander should establish and communicate which lights should be used to effectively minimize the use of warning lights. Use of Flares: In addition to the use of emergency vehicle placement as an initial traffic control set up, responders should carry enough emergency flares which can be used to set up a temporary lane closure taper until other efforts, such as traffic cones, can be placed. Flares, or other illuminated warning devices, are especially useful in low light and reduced visibility conditions to: • Warn motorists of lane changes, as the bright red lights of the flares tend to visually merge. • Supplement the visibility of traffic cone placement under night conditions. When flares are placed near cones, they not only warn upstream traffic, but the light also illuminates the cones. E-flares are a recommended alternative to “disposable” flares as they are not left at the scene. A.3.3 Emergency Signs First responders may carry flexible, roll-up signs with the EMERGENCY SCENE AHEAD message or directional arrow that can be set up quickly at an incident site using portable lightweight spring stands or other appropriate temporary mounting. The purpose of the signs is to: • Alert drivers that the temporary traffic control is a result of an emergency situation. • Alert drivers to expect responders on the highway. • Alert drivers to proceed with caution as full temporary traffic control may not yet be established. The EMERGENCY SCENE AHEAD signs should be placed on the

    shoulder of a highway by a qualified first responder (fire, enforcement,
    

    or the road authority or their agent) in advance of the incident scene.
    

BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX A: UNPLANNED EVENTS 495 At an unplanned event, responders have competing priorities, therefore, the following guidelines should be undertaken, as practicable. Guidelines for Placement of Emergency Signs: • EMERGENCY SCENE AHEAD signs should be placed to provide enough warning for vehicles to slow down before reaching the incident scene. For situations near a corner, hill, or other reduced visibility situations, may require the location of advance warning devices to be adjusted.

    • Incidents on high speed (over 80 km/h) divided highways (freeways) should have warning
    

signs placed, as practicable, approximately 160 metres in advance of the beginning of the taper. Signs should be placed on the shoulder, 2.0 metres from the edge of the travelled lane. • Warning signs on other highways should be placed approximately 20 metres in advance of the taper for speeds 60 km/h or less and 70 metres in advance of the taper for speeds above 60 km/h. Signs should be placed on the shoulder 0.3 metres to 2.0 metres from the edge of the travelled lane.

    • The directional arrow sign should be placed by a qualified first responder (fire,
    

    enforcement, or the road authority or their agent) in advance of the incident scene, at the
    

beginning of the taper where the highway user is required to navigate around an incident. • Warning and guide signs used for the incident management of emergency traffic situations should have black lettering and a black border on a fluorescent pink background. The fluorescent pink background should be restricted to emergency warning signs only. A.3.4 Traffic Cones Traffic cones are used as channelizing devices and to alert highway users to hazards in or near the travelled way. Guidelines for the Use of Cones during Unplanned Events: • Cones should provide a smooth and gradual transition in moving traffic from one lane to another, into a detour, or in reducing the width of the travelled way. • Channelizing devices may also be used to separate traffic from the incident area. • Where possible, they should be set 0.3 metres to 0.6 metres back from the edge of a live traffic lane.

    • The standard cone is the TC-51B (700 mm) with a white reflective collar.
    

• The TC-51C with a white reflective collar is an acceptable alternative TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX A: UNPLANNED EVENTS496 • The white reflective cone collar must be 100 mm to 150 mm wide, mounted on the upper one-third of the cone taper, 100 mm below the top of the cone or marker

    (Type III or IV, high intensity
    

    reflective sheeting).
    

    • The TC-51A (450 mm) may be
    

used when larger cones are

    not available; however, cones
    

should have sufficient weight to withstand wind gusts.

    • Flashing beacons (visible 360°) or flares may be used in conjunction with cones to outline
    

traffic set ups, especially the lateral buffer, and are highly recommended during low light and reduced visibility conditions.

    • On high speed freeways, lane closures should be accomplished with vehicles (that have
    

    appropriate lighting and flashing arrow board sign) rather than just using cones.
    

Guidance on the placement of cones is provided in Section A.4. A.3.5 Manual Traffic Direction Manual traffic direction may need to be provided by qualified trained personnel such as a Traffic

    Control Person (TCP) during the initial phase of the response. Normally, the TCP is one of the
    

responding law enforcement personnel, however, manual traffic direction could also be provided by

    the fire or road authority (or agent). TCP may be used to guide traffic when:
    

• Travel lanes are partially blocked. • The shoulder must be used to pass by the incident. • Only one lane is available for two-way traffic. TCP may only be used when the normal posted speed is 90 km per hour or less. Guidelines for Manual Traffic Direction: • The person directing traffic must always face the traffic, wear the appropriate HVSA, and direct traffic away from and safely around the incident by using large, extended, and consistent gestures to convey the required actions to drivers.

    • Where available, STOP/SLOW paddles (TC-22) or a flashlight with a red or orange cone
    

    attachment (traffic baton) are preferred for directing traffic. (Refer to Section 4 in OTM
    

    Book 7 for more details on procedures for manual traffic direction).
    

700 mm TC-51B 1000 mm TC-51C BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX A: UNPLANNED EVENTS 497 • When resources permit, a traffic spotter may be utilized to monitor traffic and activate an emergency signal if the actions of a motorist do not conform to established traffic control

    measures in place at the incident scene. (The use of a portable air horn or similar device is
    

    suggested as an emergency signal).
    

A.3.6 Other Available Traffic Control Devices Variable Message Signs

    Variable Message Signs (VMS), either portable or those permanently placed at critical major decision
    

points of a highway system, can be used to provide notice and information such as alerting motorists in advance of the incident of: • Lane changes. • Available alternate routes. • Detours. • Expected delays. The earlier the information can be provided, the greater the opportunity to reduce traffic demand at, and approaching, the scene as well as reduce motorist frustration. While the VMS text capability is limited, this form of communication is very effective. Information relayed can include: • Specific incident location. • Expected incident duration. • Alternate route details. • Diversion directions including non-standard motorist actions such as, driving on the shoulder. Flashing Arrow Board Signs

    Flashing arrow board signs (TC-12 or TC-12A) are additional traffic control devices used where a lane(s)
    

is closed, and traffic must merge with other traffic in an adjacent lane. These devices are brought to an incident scene at a later stage, as full compliancy with Temporary Traffic Control in OTM Book 7 is established. Some road authorities and emergency responders mount flashing arrow board signs on their work vehicles to provide guidance to road users and to support traffic control. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX A: UNPLANNED EVENTS498 Guidelines for Use of Flashing Arrow Board Signs: • Flashing arrow board signs should conform to the specifications for TC-12 or TC-12A as provided in Section 4 in OTM Book 7 to ensure visibility and consistent messaging. • Flashing arrow board signs that do not comply with TC-12 or TC-12A should be considered only supplemental, with sufficient additional traffic control devices provided to guide the highway user. • Some devices have the capacity to not only display arrows, but also text and other symbol messages such as PVMS. Responders must receive training in the actual operational requirements of flashing arrow board signs, as well as in developing appropriate message sets to fully utilize the available board functions at the incident scene. Crash Trucks Heavy trucks or trailers with rear-mounted energy adsorption attenuation equipment become a traffic

    control device, or Crash Truck (CT), when parked to protect a work zone or incident area.
    

Guidelines for Use of Crash Trucks: • The CT should be placed upstream from the incident work space with the wheels angled slightly away from the incident area and live traffic. • The CT should be unoccupied as its purpose is to protect the work area by taking any hit before an errant vehicle can enter the zone where people may be otherwise be unprotected. • The use of a CT must comply with Section 4 in OTM Book 7. Safety Support Vehicle Risks increase on highways with a posted speed of 70 km/h or greater. Therefore, on any highway with a posted speed of 70 km/h or greater, a Support Vehicle should be dispatched along with the primary response vehicles.

    A Support Vehicle can be any emergency vehicle; however, vehicles equipped with designated traffic
    

control devices should be utilized first. The Support Vehicle functions as a warning device to oncoming motorists by blocking a lane or parking on the shoulder. Personnel who operate a support vehicle may be required to: • Assist crews on scene. • Outline the perimeter of the incident scene or secure the site. • Set up any additional required safety equipment. • Establish traffic space and monitor traffic flow. • Block additional traffic lanes as required. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX A: UNPLANNED EVENTS 499 A.4 Placement of Cones/Flares A.4.1 Taper, Buffers and Incident Area Figure A.1 Placement of Cones/Flares Taper A taper, using traffic cones/flares, should be set up as soon as practicable any time there is a lane closure and/or traffic is moved from one lane to another. Walking a straight line taper can be both difficult and dangerous, and exposure to traffic flow is almost certain. Therefore, when resources permit: • A spotter should be present to assist in watching for traffic during taper set up. • Personnel should place and retrieve cones/flares while facing oncoming traffic. The speed of the highway should be considered when determining the length of a taper. Typically, a higher highway speed means the need for a longer taper. However, initial scene set up is dynamic in nature and a balance must be reached between the highway speed and the number of available cones/flares. For example, if the first responder on scene only has six cones/flares available when responding to an incident on a higher speed highway, they will be only

    able to set up a short taper; however, any taper is better than no taper. A short
    

taper should be extended as soon as resources permit.+NOTE It is recommended that emergency responder vehicles be equipped with, at a minimum, six to eight traffic cones/flares that comply with OTM Book 7. Key points to remember when setting up a taper: • A taper should encompass all equipment on the scene. • Tapers should be set up to accommodate for sight obstacles. The taper should end at the upstream end of the longitudinal buffer space. INCIDENT AREA The area occupied by responders, equipment and vehiclesTRAFFIC SPACEAllows traffic to pass through the activity area

    BUFFER SPACE (longitudinal)

    BUFFER SPACE(lateral)
    

Provides protection for traffic and responders Any taper is better than no taper. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX A: UNPLANNED EVENTS500 • Maximize the space covered with the cones/flares available. • Block as much of the highway as needed and extend the taper out as far as possible to allow drivers adequate time to merge.

    Buffer Space (Longitudinal)
    

    When setting up cones/flares, a Longitudinal Buffer Area (LBA) that is free of vehicles, equipment, and
    

people, should be provided between the end of the taper and the actual incident area. Cones/flares should be placed along the edge of the LBA, defining a clear boundary between the traffic and the buffer area. Incident Area The incident area is the section of the highway where response activities take place. Cones/flares should be placed along the edge of an incident area, starting at the end of the buffer area to help define a clear boundary between the traffic space and the activity area. When required, a lateral buffer space should also be provided. Lateral buffer space: • Is a clear area between the incident and the path of travelling vehicles. • Allows room for responders to work and can encompass partial lanes or an entire lane

    (i.e., the amount of area necessary to perform duties).
    

The amount of lateral buffer space is dependent on many conditions including, but not limited to: • Time of day. • Weather conditions. • Highway conditions. A.4.2 Conditions that Affect Cone Placement

    Cone placement should be adjusted (i.e., tapers lengthened, cones enhanced by flares) to account for
    

the following:

1.  Maximum-Posted Speed Highway speed affects warning device placement due to: • The distance travelled while reacting to the perceived hazard. For example, a vehicle that

    is travelling at 100 km/h is covering about 28 metres (91’) per second. Therefore, higher
    

speeds require longer advanced warning/visibility and tapers. • The distance required to stop the vehicle after vehicle brakes have been applied. Therefore, higher speeds require a longer buffer space and taper. 2. Obstruction of the View Obstacles can keep a driver from seeing the cones/flares, control devices, or hazards. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX A: UNPLANNED EVENTS 501 View obstructions are not the same as reduced visibility. In reduced visibility, the object gradually becomes visible. Examples of horizontal view obstructions include: • Embankments. • Hedges. • Trees. • Buildings. • Vehicles. Examples of vertical view obstructions include: • Crests of hills. • Bridges. • Overpasses that affect the sight distance or line of sight of drivers. 3. Reduced Visibility Weather and darkness do not obscure a view in the same way as solid objects, but they reduce visibility. They lessen the distance at which you can see things. Some examples include: • Darkness – lack of lighting or over-driving headlights. • Weather – fog, smoke, rain, snow, or any combination of these. • Darkness and weather may combine to further reduce visibility. The motorist may sometimes drive too fast for conditions present. 4. Glare Glare temporarily blinds the field of vision of a motorist. Examples of glare include: • Headlight glare - only at night, from oncoming traffic. • Fixed light glare - back lighting, signs, and stationary vehicles. • Sun glare - sun glare may make objects invisible to the motorist. 5. Other Factors • Motorist confusion between existing traffic control devices, signals, or pavement markings, and emergency traffic control devices.

    • Any change in alignment of a straight and level highway (i.e., elevation, curve,
    

    embankment, sudden changes in highway width, on-ramps, off-ramps, or intersections).
    

• Spacings between cones should provide a visual deterrence from having vehicles enter the closed area. For a reference value of maximum distance between cones, refer to Table A, Table B, or Table C in Section 6 in OTM Book 7. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX A: UNPLANNED EVENTS502 A.5 Positioning of Emergency Response Vehicles Emergency vehicles may be parked in such a way that they protect incident responders and secure the scene by directing traffic before additional traffic control devices arrive. Guidelines for Positioning of Emergency Response Vehicles: • Emergency vehicles should not unnecessarily impede traffic. • Emergency vehicles should only block lanes as needed to work safely and efficiently and should return the highway to normal traffic flow as quickly as possible. • Preferably, all emergency vehicles should be parked on the same side of a highway, in the same direction of the incident. • The fend-off position is the recommended method for positioning the first emergency vehicle at an incident to provide added protection to the scene from traffic. This position gives approaching motorists the best visibility of the emergency vehicle’s side while allowing them to recognize the incident. • The vehicle is positioned at an angle adequate to protect the incident. This position may also deflect any high-speed impact that would otherwise crash into the scene. • The vehicle should be positioned to provide both a longitudinal and a lateral buffer space. Subsequent Blocker Trucks or Crash Trucks that arrive on scene should park upstream in accordance with Section 4 in OTM Book 7. • Vehicles that do not protect the scene or responders should be staged in a safe area. Their location should not create a traffic hazard, obstruction, or impede other emergency vehicles. Figure A.2 Longitudinal and Lateral Buffer Space A buffer space established between the incident scene and emergency vehicles is recommended. The suggested distance is 4.0 metres for every 10 km/h of posted highway speed. Reasons for this include: • If the emergency vehicle is hit from behind, it may not be pushed into the original incident. • Apparatus remains functional for firefighting operations.

    • Scene preservation (crews will not drive inside the collision scene
    

    and destroy evidence).
    

• Cones/flares can be used to close off the buffer space to vehicular traffic by placing them along the lane pavement markings. BUFFER SPACE

The lane adjacent to the incident may be taken to provide a buffer, but an additional emergency vehicle in the fend-off position is required per additional lane. • This lateral buffer is used to reduce encroachment into the designated traffic lanes. • Traffic cones/flares should be also placed on the skip line beside the emergency vehicle. A.6 Situations that Require Special Attention Traffic Control at Rail Crossings Traffic control at any railway crossing is controlled by rail crossing signs/signals. First responders can neither stop the train nor control their signals. If an incident affects rail traffic movement or presents a hazard anywhere along the railway right-of-way:

    • Contact dispatch or the appropriate railway police authority (i.e., CNR, police).
    

• Have the trains stopped until the hazard has been removed or stabilized. Guidelines for Traffic Control at Rail Crossings: • Traffic control must be provided to prevent vehicles from stopping on railway tracks.+NOTE • Do not stop or park on the railway right-of-way. • No traffic control devices are to be used on the railway right-of-way. Each emergency agency should be familiar with contacting the appropriate railway operator within their jurisdiction. Traffic Control on High-Speed Highways High-speed highways present special problems for emergency traffic control. Moving vehicles should always be considered a threat to safety. When working on high-speed highways: • Extra care must be taken to ensure visibility and minimize exposure. • Personnel should not remain in or position themselves beside vehicles that are closing a traffic lane. Each emergency agency should be familiar with contacting the appropriate railway operator within their jurisdiction. NOTE TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX A: UNPLANNED EVENTS504 • All lane closures should start from the nearest shoulder to the incident site and extend across as many lanes as required, separately closing each lane. • Where possible, lane closures should be accomplished with vehicles instead of cones or flares. • Some incident scenes will be located at the end of a curve or near the top of a crest. In these situations, lane closures must be completed well in advance of the view obstruction to provide oncoming motorists with adequate warning. • On high-speed highways, additional advance warning devices may also be required on the approach to the lane closures. Encroachment into Incident Space during Traffic Control Operations Traffic control personnel are trained to operate, whenever possible, off the travelled portion of a highway. In case of emergencies, traffic control personnel are to: • Use their planned escape route for oncoming traffic incidents. • When safe to do so, they are to return to their assigned position and let other emergency responders handle the new emergency as required.

    Level of Service (LOS)
    

A term which, broadly interpreted, denotes any one of an infinite number of differing combinations of operating conditions that may occur on a given lane or highway when it is accommodating various

    traffic volumes. Level of service (LOS) is a qualitative measure of the effect of a number of factors,
    

which include speed and travel time, traffic interruptions, freedom to maneuver, safety, driving comfort and convenience, and operating costs. In practice, selected specific levels are defined in terms of

    particular limiting values of certain factors, as in Levels A (free-flow) to F (stop and go) in the Highway
    

Capacity Manual. LIDG See Lateral Intrusion Deterrence Gap. Live Lane A highway lane open to traffic. It includes a traffic lane where vehicles, although they may be present, are being diverted away from a stationary or mobile work activity by work vehicles or BVs equipped with traffic control devices, such as a TC-12.

    longer than 24 hours. See also Short Duration (SD), Very Short Duration (VSD), and Intermittent
    

    Duration (ID) work.
    

    Longitudinal Buffer Area (LBA)
    

LBA provides protection for traffic and workers, by providing an opportunity for highway users to

    brake to a halt between the end of the transition area and the work area or Buffer Vehicle (BV). LBA is
    

the fourth component of a work zone. Traffic control devices, work material, vehicles, and equipment must not be stored or parked in an LBA. When an LBA is used with a BV, the appropriate distance to

    use in front (downstream) of the BV is called the Lateral Intrusion Deterrence Gap (LIDG). The LIDG is
    

used in combination with the taper, LBA, and BV. Longitudinal Intrusion A longitudinal intrusion occurs when a vehicle enters a closed lane upstream of a stationary work area through the taper. The length of the lane closure taper plus the LBA upstream of the BV should provide the driver with sufficient braking distance. LOS See Level of Service. Low Volume/High Volume Highway For temporary conditions, low volume highways are defined as those with a combined traffic volume in both directions of less than 3000 vehicles per day.

or above a roadway for the purpose of regulating, warning, or guiding traffic. Traffic Signal Control System An area or corridor signal system under signalized control. Transition Area The third component of a work zone, downstream from the approach area, and upstream of the longitudinal buffer area, where traffic is channelled from a normal path to a new path required to move traffic past a work space. The transition area contains the tapers and parallel tangent sections

    (if more than one lane closed) that are used to close the lanes effectively. Work material, vehicles, and
    

equipment must not be stored or parked in transition areas. TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX B: GLOSSARY546

    Transportation Management Plan (TMP)
    

A coordinated set of strategies and work zone safety guiding principles designed to mitigate the impacts of work zone activities during the work period. Inclusion of these strategies can help achieve the fundamental principles for work zone planning, design, and operation. TRPM See Temporary Raised Pavement Marker. Truck A commercial vehicle that exceeds a specified weight or length as defined by the HTA, municipal by-law, or toll agency.

    Truck (or Trailer) Mounted Attenuator (TMA)
    

An energy-absorbing device mounted on the rear of a truck, which deforms on impact in a controlled manner, thereby reducing the rate of:

1.  Deceleration (and associated injury) for the occupants of a vehicle that has struck the TMA

    from the rear; and
    

2.  Acceleration (and associated injury) for the driver of the truck.

    TMA must satisfy the requirements of NCHRP 350 Level TL-2 (70 km/h) or TL-3 (100 km/h) and should
    

be selected for the appropriate posted speed. All TMA used on freeways must satisfy the TMA TL-3

    requirement (100 km/h).
    

TTS See Temporary Traffic Signal. Turn Lane A lane designated to facilitate vehicular turn movements from a through roadway. Turn Prohibition A regulation that prohibits a straight-through movement or a left/right turn at an intersection. Turn prohibitions are sometimes used in association with barriers that physically prevent a turn from being made. Two-lane Highway Highways with a single lane dedicated to each direction in two-way traffic. Two-way Left-turn Lane The centre lane on some of the three, five, or seven lane sections of undivided highways which is designed to facilitate left turns from each direction. BOOK 7 · TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX B: GLOSSARY 547 U Undivided Highway Highway that does not physically divide the two-way traffic. The two opposing directions are delineated with yellow pavement markings. Upstream The direction that traffic is coming from. Urban Area An area within the limits of any incorporated or unincorporated city, town, village, or any other designated residential or commercial area with a high density of population and infrastructure. V Vehicle Includes a motor vehicle, trailer, traction engine, farm tractor, road-building machine, bicycle, and any vehicle drawn, propelled, or driven by any kind of power, including muscular power, but does not include a motorized snow vehicle or motorcycle sidecar. Vehicle Arresting System Portable netting, cables, and energy-absorbing anchors designed to gradually slow down errant vehicles and prevent penetration into activity areas. Used to prevent errant vehicles from entering the work space when sections of a highway are frequently opened and closed during extended work operations.

    Very Short Duration (VSD) Work
    

Any work activity which occupies a fixed location for up to 30 minutes in duration, including set-up

    and takedown of the traffic control provisions (e.g., some utility work, minor road maintenance,
    

    stormwater catchbasin cleanout, etc.). The work site may be moved along the road and make frequent,
    

short stops. VMS See Variable Message Sign. Volume The number of vehicles or pedestrians that pass over a given section of a lane or highway, or make a

    particular movement during a specific time period (such as one hour or 24 hours).
    

VSD

    See Very Short Duration (VSD) Work.
    

TEMPORARY CONDITIONS · BOOK 7 ONTARIO TRAFFIC MANUAL · APRIL 2022APPENDIX B: GLOSSARY548 W Warning Sign A sign which indicates conditions on or adjacent to a highway or street that are actually or potentially hazardous to traffic operations. Work Area Areas where the work takes place and/or equipment and material are stored. Work area is the fifth component of a work zone, downstream from the LBA and upstream of the termination area. Work areas may or may not contain a work vehicle. Work areas may be in a fixed location or move as work progresses. There may be more than one work area within a work zone. It is still considered a work area when work has temporarily stopped yet the road has not returned to its normal operation conditions. Work Site Identification Visible identification of the work area by passive and/or active traffic control devices to show road users where work is taking place. Work Zone An area, usually made up of six component areas, where traffic control devices have been set up to provide positive guidance to highway users through a temporary situation and include the entire section from the first advance warning sign through to the last traffic control device, where traffic returns to its normal path and conditions. A work zone can be in the travelled portion of the road or on the boulevard or shoulders and may be stationary or mobile. See Mobile Operations, Very Short Duration, Short Duration, and Long Duration Work. WT Work Truck. Y Yield To cede the right of way.
