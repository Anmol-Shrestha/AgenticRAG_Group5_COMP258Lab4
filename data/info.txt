Smart City Use Cases:
• Automated pothole detection for maintenance teams
• Identifying dangerous road conditions
• Detecting broken signs affecting traffic flow
• Monitoring illegal parking patterns
• Evaluating street cleanliness levels


Recommended Preprocessing:
• Resize images to 224×224 or 256×256
• Normalize pixel values (0–1)
• Optional: CLAHE to enhance road texture visibility
• Optional: Edge detection for road cracks

Recommended Models:
• CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet, VGG16)
• Vision Transformers (ViT-B/16)
• Object Detection (YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN)
• Segmentation for fine-grained detection


Label Categories:
1. pothole
2. damaged_road
3. broken_sign
4. illegal_parking
5. garbage_or_cleanliness_issue

Each image is assigned one category, enabling supervised learning for image classification or object detection tasks
